Today we’re launching deep research in ChatGPT, a new agentic capability that conducts multi-step research on the internet for complex tasks. It accomplishes in tens of minutes what would take a human many hours.

Deep research is OpenAI's next agent that can do work for you independently—you give it a prompt, and ChatGPT will find, analyze, and synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report at the level of a research analyst. Powered by a version of the upcoming OpenAI o3 model that’s optimized for web browsing and data analysis, it leverages reasoning to search, interpret, and analyze massive amounts of text, images, and PDFs on the internet, pivoting as needed in reaction to information it encounters.

The ability to synthesize knowledge is a prerequisite for creating new knowledge. For this reason, deep research marks a significant step toward our broader goal of developing AGI, which we have long envisioned as capable of producing novel scientific research.

## Why we built deep research 

Deep research is built for people who do intensive knowledge work in areas like finance, science, policy, and engineering and need thorough, precise, and reliable research. It can be equally useful for discerning shoppers looking for hyper-personalized recommendations on purchases that typically require careful research, like cars, appliances, and furniture. Every output is fully documented, with clear citations and a summary of its thinking, making it easy to reference and verify the information. It is particularly effective at finding niche, non-intuitive information that would require browsing numerous websites. Deep research frees up valuable time by allowing you to offload and expedite complex, time-intensive web research with just one query.

Deep research independently discovers, reasons about, and consolidates insights from across the web. To accomplish this, it was trained on real-world tasks requiring browser and Python tool use, using the same reinforcement learning methods behind OpenAI o1, our first reasoning model. While o1 demonstrates impressive capabilities in coding, math, and other technical domains, many real-world challenges demand extensive context and information gathering from diverse online sources. Deep research builds on these reasoning capabilities to bridge that gap, allowing it to take on the types of problems people face in work and everyday life.

## How to use deep research

In ChatGPT, select ‘deep research’ in the message composer and enter your query. Tell ChatGPT what you need—whether it’s a competitive analysis on streaming platforms or a personalized report on the best commuter bike. You can attach files or spreadsheets to add context to your question. Once it starts running, a sidebar appears with a summary of the steps taken and sources used.

Deep research may take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes to complete its work, taking the time needed to dive deep into the web. In the meantime, you can step away or work on other tasks—you’ll get a notification once the research is complete. The final output arrives as a report within the chat – in the next few weeks, we will also be adding embedded images, data visualizations, and other analytic outputs in these reports for additional clarity and context.

Compared to deep research, GPT‑4o is ideal for real-time, multimodal conversations. For **multi-faceted, domain-specific** inquiries where depth and detail are critical, deep research’s ability to conduct extensive exploration and cite each claim is the difference between a quick summary and a well-documented, verified answer that can be usable as a work product.

In the United States, iOS leads with a 58.81% market share. Other developed countries like Japan, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom also show a higher preference for iOS devices. In contrast, developing countries such as India and Brazil have a higher prevalence of Android devices.
* **Interest in Language Learning:** While specific percentages of populations interested in learning another language are not readily available, the global popularity of language learning apps like Duolingo, which had approximately 14.3 million downloads in July 2024, indicates a significant interest. This interest is likely higher in countries with diverse linguistic landscapes or where English is not the primary language.
* **Mobile Penetration Over the Past Decade:** Mobile phone ownership has seen substantial growth globally. In the United States, smartphone ownership increased from 35% in 2011 to 91% in 2024\. Developing countries have also experienced significant growth in mobile penetration, contributing to increased access to digital services.

**Recommendations:**

Considering the available data and focusing on markets where ChatGPT is currently active, the following developed countries are promising targets for a new iOS translation app:

* **United States:** High iOS market share and significant interest in language learning.
* **United Kingdom:** Substantial iOS user base and a multicultural population with diverse language needs.
* **Canada:** Notable iOS adoption and a bilingual population (English and French), increasing the demand for translation services.

Among developing countries, the following are noteworthy:

* **China:** Despite Android's dominance, the large population and growing interest in English and other languages present a significant opportunity.
* **India:** High Android usage, but a growing middle class with increasing iOS adoption and a strong interest in language learning, especially English.
* **Brazil:** Predominantly Android users, but with a sizable market for language learning apps, particularly for English and Spanish.

Focusing on these markets aligns with ChatGPT's current availability and leverages existing mobile adoption trends and language learning interests.

**Sources:** Smartphone OS shares are from StatCounter/Statista data (2023–24). Language-interest metrics come from surveys by Preply, Eurobarometer, Babbel, etc. (e.g. UK 73% interest; US 70% regret lack of languages; Japan >50% want English; Pearson global survey). Mobile penetration is measured as smartphone ownership percentage – dramatic growth is noted in developing markets (e.g. Brazil +40 points) and high saturation in developed ones (e.g. UK \~82%) over the last decade.

**Recommendations:** Based on the above, prime targets for a new **ChatGPT‑powered iOS translation app** would be countries with **large iOS user bases** _and_ **strong language-learning demand**, where ChatGPT is accessible. Notably, **Japan, the U.S., UK, Canada, and Australia** emerge as top choices. These markets pair high iOS adoption (50–60%+ share) with significant enthusiasm for language learning – for example, Japan’s iPhone dominance and widespread desire to learn English make it ideal. English-speaking countries like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, despite being monolingual societies, show substantial interest in learning other languages (e.g. Spanish or French), and all have over 80% smartphone penetration and millions of iPhone users.

Among emerging economies, **Mexico and Brazil** stand out as secondary targets: although Android prevails, their sheer population sizes mean tens of millions of iPhone users exist, and interest in English is very high for career and education reasons. These Latin American markets (where ChatGPT is active) could yield strong adoption for an iOS-only app, especially given the motivation to learn English. Conversely, **China** and **Russia** are less feasible – China’s OS split skews Android and ChatGPT is not officially available there, and Russia faces access and regulatory uncertainties.

In summary, **focus on iOS-heavy, pro-learning markets**: Japan and Western countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia, plus high-income Europe like **Germany** and **France** to a lesser degree) should be the first-tier targets. They combine robust iOS usage with favorable language-learning attitudes. A second tier includes large-population developing markets (Mexico, Brazil, perhaps **Saudi Arabia** for its historically high iPhone uptake) where interest in English is strong – these can be approached once the app gains traction in the primary markets. Such a strategy ensures the app launches where it has the greatest alignment of platform (iOS) presence and user demand for translation/language tools, maximizing the likelihood of adoption and growth.

## GPT-4o

There is a TV show that I watched a while ago. I forgot the name but I do remember what happened in one of the episodes. Can you help me find the name? Here is what I remember in one of the episodes:

* Two men play poker. One folds after another tells him to bet. The one who folded actually had a good hand and fell for the bluff. On the second hand, the same man folds again, but this time with a bad hand.
* A man gets locked in the room, and then his daughter knocks on the door.
* Two men go to a butcher shop, and one man brings a gift of vodka.

Based on the details you've provided, it seems you're referring to an episode from the television series Servant. This psychological horror series, created by Tony Basgallop and executive produced by M. Night Shyamalan, premiered on Apple TV+ in 2019\. The narrative centers on a Philadelphia couple who, after experiencing a profound loss, hire a young nanny, leading to a series of unsettling events within their home.

In one of the episodes, there is a scene where two characters engage in a tense poker game, with one character folding to a bluff despite holding a strong hand. In another scene, a man finds himself locked in a room, only to have his daughter knock on the door shortly after. Additionally, two characters visit a butcher shop, where one presents a bottle of vodka as a gift.

If this aligns with your recollection, then Servant is likely the show you're thinking of.

All three described events occur in **the Starz series** **_Counterpart_** **, Season 1 Episode 4, titled “Both Sides Now.”** In this episode:

* **Poker game bluff:** Howard Silk (from Dimension 2) plays poker with his kinder Dimension 1 counterpart. He taunts the other to bet, but Howard-1 folds a winning hand (he had top pair) after falling for the bluff. On the next hand, Howard-1 folds again (this time correctly, with a bad hand).
* **Locked in a room & daughter knocks:** Howard-1 is locked in an apartment by Howard-2\. A knock comes – it’s Howard-2’s daughter, Anna, calling “Dad.” She says her mother is in the hospital and drags “Howard” out, not realizing he’s the other version of her father.
* **Butcher shop with vodka:** Later, Howard-2 and Peter Quayle visit an old ally, Heinrich, at his butcher shop. Howard-2 brings a bottle of Russian Standard vodka as a gift. Heinrich happily breaks out glasses, saying he misses the stuff, and they toast.

Each of these moments is a plot point in **“Both Sides Now” (Counterpart S1E4)**, confirming it as the episode in question.

**Sources:** The _Counterpart_ episode summary on the Counterpart Wiki details the poker bluff, the locked-room encounter with the daughter, and the butcher shop vodka scene, all in _Season 1, Episode 4: “Both Sides Now.”_

In this example, deep research is given an ambiguous query that would be hard for a human to find the answer to, because there are no key words that would easily reveal the answer to the query. Deep research is able to search creatively and persistently until it finds an answer that exactly matches the criteria.

## GPT-4o

Do a deep dive into attempts to improve the reprogramming efficiency of OSKM by directly modifying the protein sequences of the four Yamanaka factors. List all relevant papers you find, the authors, the methods used, and the results. Study the patterns in the changes to the proteins and corresponding results across the papers and list the top 3 domains that scientists modify to increase efficiency, and why they believe these changes are effective.

Direct modifications to the protein sequences of the Yamanaka factors—Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (collectively known as OSKM)—have been explored to enhance the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Below is a summary of relevant studies, including authors, methods, and key findings:

**1\. Study on Klf4 Isoforms**

* **Authors:** Knut Woltjen et al.
* **Methods:** Investigation of the impact of different Klf4 isoforms on reprogramming efficiency.
* **Results:** The study found that the length of Klf4 influences reprogramming outcomes. Specifically, Klf4 proteins differing by nine amino acids in length, due to alternative start codons, were used in various laboratories. The choice of isoform affected the efficiency of reprogramming, suggesting that specific protein sequence variations in Klf4 can modulate the reprogramming process.

**2\. Study on Recombinant OSKM Proteins with Polyarginine Tags**

* **Authors:** Researchers referenced in "The use of small molecules in somatic-cell reprogramming."
* **Methods:** Utilization of recombinant OSKM proteins tagged with a cell-penetrant polyarginine sequence to facilitate cellular uptake without genetic modification.
* **Results:** The tagged recombinant proteins successfully entered cells and induced reprogramming, eliminating the need for genetic material transfer. However, this method was noted to be inefficient and required large amounts of recombinant protein, limiting its widespread application.

**3\. Study on Oct4 Variants**

* **Authors:** Researchers referenced in "Oct-4."
* **Methods:** Comparison of Oct4 with its close relatives, Oct1 and Oct6, in their ability to induce pluripotency.
* **Results:** The study demonstrated that while Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc could be replaced by their respective family members, Oct4's closer relatives, Oct1 and Oct6, failed to induce pluripotency. This highlights the exclusiveness of Oct4 among POU transcription factors in reprogramming, suggesting that specific sequences within Oct4 are critical for its function in inducing pluripotency.

**Patterns in Protein Modifications and Reprogramming Efficiency**

Across these studies, certain patterns emerge regarding modifications to the Yamanaka factors and their impact on reprogramming efficiency:

* **Isoform Selection:** The choice of specific protein isoforms, such as the length variants of Klf4, can significantly influence reprogramming outcomes. This suggests that even minor differences in protein sequences can alter the efficiency of inducing pluripotency.
* **Protein Tagging:** Adding cell-penetrant sequences, like polyarginine tags, to OSKM proteins facilitates their entry into cells without genetic modification. While this approach can induce reprogramming, it often requires high protein concentrations and may suffer from low efficiency.
* **Factor Specificity:** The unique effectiveness of Oct4, compared to its close relatives Oct1 and Oct6, underscores the importance of specific protein sequences in reprogramming. This indicates that certain domains within these factors are crucial for their function in inducing pluripotency.

**Top Three Domains Modified to Increase Reprogramming Efficiency**

Based on the studies and patterns observed, the following domains within the Yamanaka factors are commonly targeted to enhance reprogramming efficiency:

**1** **. DNA-Binding Domains:**

* **Reason for Modification:** Altering the DNA-binding domains can enhance the specificity and affinity of the factors for target genes crucial in reprogramming. For instance, selecting specific isoforms of Klf4 that may have variations in their DNA-binding domains can influence reprogramming efficiency.

**2\.** **Transactivation Domains:**

* **Reason for Modification:** Modifying transactivation domains can increase the transcriptional activity of the factors, thereby upregulating genes essential for maintaining pluripotency. Enhancements in these domains can lead to more efficient reprogramming by promoting the expression of target genes.

**3\. Nuclear Localization Signals (NLS):**

* **Reason for Modification:** Enhancing the NLS within these factors ensures their efficient transport into the nucleus, where they exert their function. Improved nuclear localization can increase the availability of these factors at their sites of action, thereby enhancing reprogramming efficiency.

Researchers believe these modifications are effective because they optimize the functional capabilities of the Yamanaka factors, ensuring that they more effectively activate the genetic networks necessary for reprogramming somatic cells into iPSCs.

## Deep research

Do a deep dive into attempts to improve the reprogramming efficiency of OSKM by directly modifying the protein sequences of the four Yamanaka factors. List all relevant papers you find, the authors, the methods used, and the results. Study the patterns in the changes to the proteins and corresponding results across the papers and list the top 3 domains that scientists modify to increase efficiency, and why they believe these changes are effective.

**Introduction:** Cellular reprogramming with Yamanaka’s OSKM factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc) is notoriously inefficient (often <0.1% in human fibroblasts). Researchers have therefore engineered these proteins’ sequences to boost their reprogramming activity. Below we review key studies (across mouse, human, and other systems) that directly modified OSKM protein sequences – via domain fusions, point mutations, truncations, or factor substitutions – to enhance iPSC induction. Both successful and unsuccessful modifications are included for a complete perspective. We first list the major papers and then discuss their methods, results, and emerging themes.

**Key Studies (Chronological Overview):**

1. **Takahashi & Yamanaka (Cell, 2006)** – “Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors.” (Kazutoshi Takahashi, Shinya Yamanaka; Aug 25, 2006). Landmark discovery of OSKM-induced iPSCs (baseline OSKM, no protein modifications).
2. **Nakagawa et al. (PNAS, 2010)** – “Promotion of direct reprogramming by transformation-deficient Myc.” (Masato Nakagawa et al.; Aug 10, 2010). Demonstrated that using **Myc variants** with reduced oncogenicity (L-Myc or c-Myc point mutants) enhances iPSC generation efficiency while minimizing tumorigenicity.
3. **Wang et al. (EMBO Reports, 2011)** – “Reprogramming of mouse and human somatic cells by high-performance engineered factors.” (Yang Wang et al.; Apr 2011). Created **synthetic OSKM factors fused to the VP16 transactivation domain**, achieving dramatically higher reprogramming efficiencies in both mouse and human cells.
4. **Hirai et al. (Stem Cells, 2011)** – “Radical acceleration of nuclear reprogramming by chromatin remodeling with the transactivation domain of MyoD.” (Hiroyuki Hirai et al.; 2011). Fused the **MyoD activator domain** to Oct4, showing faster reprogramming (5% efficiency in MEFs) and improved chromatin opening.
5. **Hirai et al. (PLOS ONE, 2012)** – “Efficient iPS Cell Production with the MyoD Transactivation Domain in Serum-Free Culture.” (Hiroyuki Hirai et al.; Mar 30, 2012). Optimized culture conditions for MyoD–Oct4 fusion (“**M3O**”) achieving **\~26%** iPSC yield in mouse fibroblasts vs \~2% with wild-type Oct4, and \~7% in human cells vs 1% with OSKM.
6. **Hammachi et al. (Cell Reports, 2012)** – “Transcriptional activation by Oct4 is sufficient for the maintenance and induction of pluripotency.” (Fella Hammachi et al.; Jul 2012). Showed that **Oct4 fused to activator domains** (e.g. VP16) can sustain pluripotency; an Oct4-VP16 chimera could replace wild-type Oct4 in reprogramming, indicating Oct4’s activation function is key.
7. **Kong et al. (Nucleic Acids Res, 2015)** – “Functional interplay between the RK motif and linker segment dictates Oct4–DNA recognition.” (Xiangqian Kong et al.; May 2015). Identified **gain-of-function Oct4 point mutants** in the DNA-binding domain with \~3-fold higher reprogramming efficiency, by mutating inhibitory residues in Oct4’s POU linker region.
8. **Shah, Narayan, Ptashne et al. (Cell Reports, 2017)** – “OCT4 and SOX2 work as transcriptional activators in reprogramming human fibroblasts.” (Shivangi Shah, Santosh Narayan, Mark Ptashne et al.; Aug 2017). Demonstrated that **Sox2-VP16 (activator fusion)** accelerates and increases human iPSC formation, especially in harder-to-reprogram older donor cells. Conversely, a repressor fusion (Sox2-HP1) abolished iPSC formation.
9. **Hou et al. (Nucleic Acids Res, 2020)** – “Concurrent binding to DNA and RNA facilitates the pluripotency reprogramming activity of Sox2.” (Linlin Hou et al.; Apr 2020). Discovered an **RNA-binding motif (RBM)** in Sox2’s C-terminal domain that is critical for reprogramming. Deleting this 60-aa motif (Sox2-ΔRBM) was an unsuccessful modification, yielding \~36-fold fewer iPSC colonies, underscoring the RBM’s importance.
10. **Borisova et al. (iScience, 2022)** – “Structurally-discovered KLF4 variants accelerate and stabilize reprogramming to pluripotency.” (Evgeniia Borisova et al.; Jan 2022). Performed alanine-scanning of the **Klf4 zinc-finger domain**, finding one mutant (Klf4-L507A) that roughly **doubled** reprogramming efficiency in both mouse and human cells and hastened iPSC colony formation.
11. **Akifuji et al. (Sci. Reports, 2021)** – “MYCL promotes iPSC-like colony formation via MYC Box 0 and 2 domains.” (Chiaki Akifuji et al.; Dec 2021). Probed why **L-Myc outperforms c-Myc**. Deletions showed Myc’s **Box0 and Box2 domains** are crucial for efficient reprogramming (loss of either in L-Myc abolished iPSC formation). This explains L-Myc’s greater efficacy and lower oncogenicity compared to c-Myc.

**Protein Modification Strategies & Findings:**

* **Fusion of Transactivation Domains to Yamanaka Factors:** One recurring strategy is to endow OSKM factors with super-activating domains to drive pluripotency genes more strongly. The herpesvirus VP16 acidic activation domain is a common choice – it robustly recruits the transcriptional machinery. **Wang et al. (2011)** first showed that fusing VP16 to Oct4, Sox2, or Nanog creates “hyperactive” factors that dramatically improve reprogramming. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), replacing Oct4 with Oct4-VP16 increased iPSC colony numbers by \~**78-fold** (236 vs 3 colonies). Sox2-VP16 gave a \~36-fold boost, and adding Nanog-VP16 further raised efficiency (the 4-factor cocktail with three VP16-fusions yielded 100× more colonies than wild-type OSKM). Remarkably, **Oct4–VP16 alone** (even without Sox2/Klf4/Myc) was later shown to reprogram MEFs at \~0.2–0.3% efficiency – comparable to the full OSKM cocktail. Similarly, **Hammachi et al. (2012)** found that tethering strong activators to Oct4 sustains pluripotency: an Oct4–VP16 fusion could maintain ESC self-renewal and induce iPSCs, whereas an Oct4–HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) fusion, which represses transcription, failed to reprogram cells. These studies established that Oct4 and Sox2 primarily function as _transcriptional activators_ during reprogramming, and amplifying their activation domains greatly increases efficiency.  
    
Another successful fusion strategy was to attach domains from **myogenic transcription factor MyoD**. **Hirai et al. (2011, 2012)** created an Oct4–MyoD chimera (termed **“M\_3O”**), hypothesizing it would better remodel chromatin. Indeed, M\_3O with SKM reprogrammed \~5% of MEFs in 2011\. In a follow-up with serum-free, low-density culture, **Hirai 2012** achieved **25–30%** efficiency with M\_3O+SKM – a huge jump from \~2% with wild-type Oct4 (OSKM) under the same conditions. M\_3O proved superior to even large VP16 fusions of Oct4, suggesting the MyoD TAD particularly well-suited for opening embryonic gene loci. Notably, M\_3O also worked in human fibroblasts (yield \~7% vs 1% for OSKM), showing cross-species efficacy. These fusion approaches consistently indicate that **augmenting Oct4/Sox2’s transactivation capability** is a powerful way to overcome reprogramming barriers.  
    
_Unsuccessful domain fusions:_ Not all factors benefit from added domains – outcomes depended on the factor’s role. Wang et al. reported that fusing VP16 to Klf4 or expressing VP16 alone did **not** enhance reprogramming, implying Klf4’s native function or expression level was not limiting in their system. Likewise, fusing a **repressor domain** (HP1) to Sox2 completely **blocked** iPSC formation, underlining that activation (not repression) by Sox2 is required. These controls reinforce that only specific modifications (strong activators to Oct4/Sox2/Nanog) yield efficiency gains, whereas mis‐routing a factor’s function can abolish activity.
* **Point Mutations and Internal Deletions of Domains:** A finer approach has been to mutate specific amino acids or domains within OSKM proteins to relieve inhibitory regulation or improve DNA binding. **Oct4 (POU5F1)** has been a prime target. Oct4 contains a bipartite DNA-binding POU domain (POUs and POUh subdomains separated by a flexible linker) and several regulatory motifs. _Kong et al. (2015)_ discovered that mutations in Oct4’s POU linker can \*\*enhance its DNA binding and reprogramming function. They showed that glutamic acid residues in the linker (e.g. E210/E217 in mouse Oct4) form intramolecular contacts with the DNA-binding “RK motif” (arginine-lysine rich loop) and partially inhibit Oct4’s ability to engage DNA. Disrupting these contacts via alanine substitution (e.g. Oct4-E219A in mouse, corresponding to human E210A) freed Oct4 to bind target genes more avidly. An Oct4 triple mutant (three glutamate-to-alanine changes in the linker) exhibited \~**3-fold higher** reprogramming efficiency than wild-type. These **gain-of-function Oct4 mutants** still required co-factors Sox2/Klf4, but significantly increased colony yields. This trend highlights that **tuning Oct4’s DNA-interface** (either by adding an exogenous TAD or by removing autoinhibitory elements) improves activation of the pluripotency network.  
    
Post-translational modification sites on Oct4 have also been targeted. _Brumbaugh et al. (PNAS 2012)_ identified two phosphorylation sites in human OCT4’s DNA-binding homeodomain (T234, S235) whose modification impairs Oct4’s function. They showed that a phospho-mimetic mutant (T234E/S235E) was greatly compromised – it yielded **far fewer iPSC colonies** than wild-type Oct4 (few colonies formed, indicating loss of function). Conversely, a non-phosphorylatable mutant (T234A/S235A) performed at least as well as wild-type (in some trials modestly better). These results indicate that **phosphorylation of Oct4’s homeodomain negatively regulates reprogramming efficiency** by reducing DNA binding. Thus, mutating Oct4 to block that phosphorylation can maintain Oct4 in a more active DNA-binding state, benefiting reprogramming (whereas enforcing constant phosphorylation is detrimental).  
    
**Sox2** has an HMG DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal transactivation region. Intriguingly, a recent finding by _Hou et al. (2020)_ revealed Sox2 also harbors an **RNA-binding motif (RBM)** in its C-terminus that contributes to reprogramming. Deleting this 60-residue RBM (creating Sox2-ΔRBM) severely reduced iPSC yields – **36-fold fewer colonies** relative to wild-type Sox2\. The authors showed Sox2’s RBM enables it to bind certain RNAs while still bound to DNA, which facilitates somatic gene silencing and pluripotency gene activation during reprogramming. This was an _unsuccessful modification attempt_ (it impeded reprogramming), but it identifies a new **domain critical for Sox2’s reprogramming activity**. It cautions that deleting or altering domains without understanding their function can abolish factor activity – in this case, Sox2’s ability to coordinate RNA processing was key to efficient iPSC induction.  
    
**Klf4** is a zinc-finger (ZnF) transcription factor with three C2H2 ZnFs at its C-terminus responsible for DNA binding. _Borisova et al. (2022)_ performed a systematic mutagenesis of Klf4’s ZnF region to find variants that speed up reprogramming. They identified a single substitution, **Klf4-L507A**, that markedly improved performance. This leucine at position 507 (in the third zinc finger) was predicted to contact DNA; mutating it to alanine likely alters the protein-DNA interface. In reprogramming assays, Klf4-L507A consistently **produced iPSC colonies faster and at roughly double the efficiency** of wild-type Klf4\. For example, in Nanog-GFP reporter MEFs, \~60% of cells transduced with Klf4-L507A became Nanog+ iPSC colonies by day 25, versus \~30% with wild-type Klf4\. This mutant also worked with human fibroblasts to increase TRA-1-60+ pluripotent colony formation. Mechanistically, L507A showed enhanced binding to pluripotency gene promoters (e.g. Klf5) and may stabilize Klf4’s DNA-contact conformation. Interestingly, most other alanine mutants of Klf4 either had no effect or _decreased_ reprogramming (several abolished colony formation entirely). Deletions of entire ZnF domains likewise eliminate Klf4’s ability to induce iPSCs (e.g. a mutant lacking two zinc fingers fails to reprogram). Thus, **Klf4’s DNA-binding domain can be finely tuned** – one specific change improved efficiency, but many others disrupted the critical DNA contacts. The L507A success underscores how structure-guided mutations can yield “hyperactive” reprogramming factors.
* **Modifying c-Myc for Enhanced & Safer Reprogramming:** The proto-oncogene c-Myc boosts reprogramming efficiency \~10–40×, but its use raises the risk of tumorigenesis. Researchers have tried altering Myc’s protein sequence to retain reprogramming function while reducing its cancerous potential. **Nakagawa et al. (2010)** made the seminal observation that **L-Myc** (the less oncogenic Myc family member) can substitute for c-Myc to promote iPSC generation _more efficiently and specifically_ than c-Myc. In human fibroblasts, L-Myc gave higher iPSC yields than c-Myc, and in mouse chimeras L-Myc did not induce tumors whereas c-Myc did. They also tested **c-Myc mutants** defective in transformation: notably **W136E** (a point mutation in Myc’s Myc Box II domain) and **ΔN2** (deletion of Myc’s N-terminal Myc Box II segment). These mutants have **little transforming activity** but Nakagawa et al. found they still **enhanced iPSC formation** – in fact, they promoted human iPSC colonies more efficiently than wild-type c-Myc. This striking result showed that Myc’s reprogramming function can be uncoupled from its oncogenic function. Mechanistically, c-Myc’s N-terminal Myc Box domains (MBI and MBII) drive proliferation and tumorigenesis, whereas apparently the same or overlapping regions also aid in resetting cell identity; the transformation-deficient mutants presumably still activate the proliferation/apoptosis genes needed to facilitate reprogramming, but without triggering neoplastic programs. These findings led to widespread adoption of L-Myc in iPSC protocols to avoid using c-Myc.  
    
Building on that, **Akifuji et al. (2021)** dissected _why_ L-Myc outperforms c-Myc by systematically deleting conserved **Myc Box (MB) domains**. Myc proteins have six MB domains (MB0–MB5) that mediate protein–protein interactions. Akifuji’s team compared reprogramming ability of c-Myc vs L-Myc mutants in human cells. They found **two domains – MB0 and MB2 – are absolutely required** for efficient iPSC induction, especially in L-Myc. Deleting MB0 or MB2 from L-Myc **completely abrogated** colony formation (no iPSCs at all), whereas deleting other domains had milder effects. In c-Myc, loss of MB2 was also detrimental, but loss of MB0 was more tolerated (unlike in L-Myc). This suggests L-Myc’s superior performance stems from functional differences in how its MB0 operates. Proteomic analysis showed L-Myc’s **MB0 domain** uniquely upregulates cell-adhesion and MET (mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition) related genes, aiding the early reprogramming switch. MB2, on the other hand, helps recruit RNA-processing factors in both c-Myc and L-Myc, impacting protein synthesis and cell growth during reprogramming. Thus, the **MB0 and MB2 domains** emerged as key effectors of Myc-driven reprogramming efficiency. These insights explain why **L-Myc (which has an intact MB0 and MB2 but is less oncogenic)** is a sweet spot: it triggers proliferation and MET processes helpful for reprogramming, without strongly activating the tumorigenic pathways tied to c-Myc. From a protein-engineering perspective, one could imagine designing a c-Myc variant that mimics L-Myc’s domain functions – effectively leveraging MB0/MB2 while disabling the pro-tumor elements of MB1/MBII – as an optimal reprogramming factor. Indeed, the 2010 study’s c-Myc-W136E mutant in MBII is one example of such a partial decoupling.  
    
_Other Myc modifications:_ Some groups have simply omitted c-Myc entirely (to avoid its risks), but this typically drops efficiency \~10–100 fold. Others have tried small-molecule Myc replacements or regulated Myc expression, but those fall outside protein sequence changes. The **L-Myc swap** and **MBII mutants** remain the principal protein-level tweaks to the Myc factor itself that improved the reprogramming outcome.

**Trends and Effective Strategies:** Clear patterns emerge from these studies. A major theme is that **increasing the transcriptional activating power** of the core pluripotency factors (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog) yields more iPSCs. Whether by fusing potent activation domains (VP16, MyoD TAD) or by removing inhibitory phosphosites and autoinhibitory contacts, the goal is to drive endogenous pluripotency genes (Oct4, Nanog, etc.) more strongly and swiftly. This often translates to higher and earlier activation of the pluripotent gene network, giving more colonies in a shorter time. For example, VP16-fused factors reactivate silent pluripotency loci faster than wild-type factors. Thus, **enhanced transactivation** is a recurring successful strategy. Alongside this, **optimizing DNA-binding interactions** of OSKM is another fruitful approach – Oct4 and Klf4 mutants that bind target sites with higher affinity or specificity produce more iPSC colonies. In essence, making these factors better at finding and turning on the right genes improves reprogramming.

Another trend is **modulating factor domains to separate “good” reprogramming functions from “bad” side effects**. This is exemplified by c-Myc: modifications that drop Myc’s oncogenic transformation activity (e.g. removing MBII) while keeping its pro-proliferation activity enhance reprogramming _and_ safety. Likewise, one Oct4 mutant (Oct4-E208A) identified by Kong et al. showed higher reprogramming efficiency without disrupting other necessary protein–protein interactions, essentially a cleaner activation function. In contrast, some modifications taught us what _not_ to change: e.g., deleting Sox2’s RBM crippled reprogramming, indicating that domain’s positive role; similarly, certain Klf4 ZnF mutants abolished activity, revealing those residues are indispensable. Including such “unsuccessful” attempts in the analysis helps pinpoint which domains are absolutely required versus which can be engineered for gain of function.

**Most Frequently Targeted Domains:** From the collective data, three protein regions stand out as the most commonly modified in efforts to boost OSKM function:

1. **Transactivation Domains (TADs)** – While OSKM factors have their own activation domains, researchers frequently add **heterologous TADs** to amplify their effect. The viral **VP16 TAD** is the prototypical example, used in multiple studies for Oct4, Sox2, Nanog fusions. The **MyoD TAD** (a strong acidic activator from a muscle TF) is another, used in Hirai’s Oct4-M\_3O. These domains recruit co-activators (p300/CBP, Mediator, etc.) en masse, thus modified factors can robustly turn on pluripotency genes that somatic chromatin normally silences. TAD fusion is effective because it bypasses some rate-limiting steps in epigenetic activation – for instance, Oct4-VP16 can activate endogenous OCT4 and NANOG loci at lower protein levels than wild-type Oct4\. In summary, **VP16 and other exogenous TADs** are popular and effective additions to OSKM, often yielding order-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency (e.g. 10–100× more colonies). The success of this strategy across species (mouse and human) in multiple labs makes TAD fusion arguably the most impactful modification type discovered.
2. **DNA-binding Domains and Linkers (Oct4 POU domain & Klf4 zinc fingers):** The portions of OSKM that contact DNA – and their adjacent regulatory motifs – are another frequent focus. Oct4’s POU domain has been engineered in two ways: (i) _Surface mutations_ in the minor-groove binding RK motif or its linker, which increased DNA-binding affinity and yielded more efficient reprogramming; and (ii) _Preventing inhibitory modifications_ (like the Oct4 T234/S235 phosphorylation in the homeodomain) to keep DNA binding robust. These modifications target the “core business” of Oct4 as a transcription factor: by ensuring Oct4 binds the right genes more avidly (either via structural changes or by removing a phosphate that would weaken binding), the cell’s fate can be reset more easily. Klf4’s zinc-finger domain is analogous – the **KLF4–L507A** mutant alters the interface of the third ZnF, apparently allowing tighter or more prolonged binding at pluripotent gene promoters. This mutant doubled iPSC yields and even made resulting iPSCs more homogeneous in Nanog expression, suggesting a qualitative improvement in reprogramming. In general, **mutating DNA-contact residues** (positively in Oct4 and Klf4’s case) or domain swaps between POU factors (e.g. Oct4 vs. the less effective Oct6, as examined in some studies) have been common experiments. The recurring outcome is that relatively small changes in DNA-binding domains can have outsized effects on reprogramming efficiency – likely because binding site affinity/specificity is a key determinant of how effectively OSKM can activate endogenous pluripotency genes.
3. **Myc’s N-terminal Myc Box Domains (especially MB0 and MBII):** For c-Myc (and its variant L-Myc), the **Myc Box regions** in the transactivation domain are the critical modulators of reprogramming versus transformation. Many studies (Nakagawa 2010, Akifuji 2021) converged on **MBII (Myc Box II)** as necessary for reprogramming promotion, but also responsible for Myc’s oncogenic effects. The point mutation W136E in MBII disrupts interaction with histone acetyltransferase complexes (TRRAP/p400) – this ablates transformation but still permits reprogramming aid. Meanwhile, **MB0** (Myc Box 0, a lesser-known domain at the extreme N-terminus) emerged as another major contributor in L-Myc. MB0 differs slightly between c- vs L-Myc, and Akifuji et al. found it influences cell-adhesion gene expression and MET during reprogramming. Because **MB0 and MBII (MB2)** are “hotspots” for modifying Myc’s behavior, they are the most frequently altered domains in Myc engineering studies. Researchers either swap the whole factor (c-Myc → L-Myc, effectively changing the MB0/MBII context), or create specific mutants/deletions in these domains. The effectiveness of these modifications is measured not just by colony count but also by **quality and safety** of iPSCs. For instance, using L-Myc (with an intact MB0 but inherently attenuated oncogenicity) yielded iPSC lines that contributed to mouse germline with no tumors. Thus, targeting Myc’s MB domains has been an effective strategy to **improve the risk-benefit ratio** of reprogramming – maintaining high efficiency while mitigating cancer risk.

**Cross-Species and Additional Context:** Most modifications above were tested in **mouse and human** cells, with broadly similar results. VP16 fusions worked in both species (though absolute efficiencies differ). MyoD–Oct4 was shown in mouse and partially in human. Myc’s L-Myc advantage was demonstrated in mouse (chimeras) and human fibroblasts. Klf4-L507A was functionally validated in mouse MEFs and human cells (fibroblasts and keratinocytes). This cross-species consistency suggests these protein-level tweaks tap into fundamental mechanisms of the reprogramming process. It’s also worth noting that **older studies** laid the groundwork by showing what wild-type OSKM can and cannot do (e.g. the requirement for Oct4 and Sox2 as activators, the severe efficiency drop without c-Myc). Building on that, newer advancements use modern tools (structural modeling, alanine scanning, phosphoproteomics, etc.) to rationally design improved factor versions.

**Conclusion:** In summary, a wealth of research has attempted to “turbo-charge” the Yamanaka factors by altering their protein sequences. Successful approaches include appending strong activation domains (e.g. VP16, MyoD TAD) to Oct4/Sox2, introducing point mutations in Oct4 or Klf4 that strengthen DNA binding or prevent inhibitory phosphorylation, and using Myc variants or mutants that dissociate reprogramming potency from tumorigenic risk. These modifications have yielded **quantitative gains in reprogramming efficiency** – often boosting iPSC yields from well below 0.5% into the several-percent range or higher, and in special cases (MyoD–Oct4) into double digits. Just as importantly, studying both effective and ineffective modifications has illuminated which **protein domains are pivotal for reprogramming**. The top three targeted domains have been: (1) exogenous **transactivation domains** like VP16 (to amplify transcriptional activation); (2) the **core DNA-binding domains** of pioneer factors (Oct4’s POU and Klf4’s ZnF, including their regulatory linker motifs); and (3) the **Myc Box domains** of c-Myc/L-Myc (which govern the balance between proliferation and transformation). Modifications in these regions are believed to work by either unlocking latent activity of the factors (e.g. relieving autoinhibition or recruiting more co-factors) or by disconnecting undesired functions (e.g. oncogenesis) from the reprogramming process.

The trajectory from older landmark findings to recent advances shows a clear maturation of the field: from initially swapping whole factors (c-Myc to L-Myc) to _domain-level engineering_ and precise amino-acid substitutions. Each iterative improvement has taught us more about the biology of reprogramming. While no single “super-factor” has yet made reprogramming routine, the compiled evidence makes it clear that the efficiency ceiling can be raised by protein engineering. Combining multiple enhancements – for example, using an Oct4-VP16 + Sox2-VP16 + Klf4-L507A + L-Myc cocktail – might synergistically produce even greater efficiency, an idea some studies have begun to explore (Wang 2011’s use of three synthetic factors was a step in this direction). In closing, direct modifications of OSKM proteins have proven to be a fertile strategy for improving iPSC technology, offering both practical benefits (faster, higher-yield reprogramming) and deeper insight into the **structure-function relationships** that underlie cell-fate conversion.

## GPT-4o

Find evidence that shows that buttons with icons & labels are more usable than buttons without labels, or labels without icons. I know there’s been a lot of user studies on it, would love to see a detailed report along with a high-level , once definitive answer on the effectiveness.

Research indicates that buttons combining both icons and text labels are generally more effective than those featuring only one of these elements. Icons alone can often be ambiguous due to varying interpretations across different contexts. For instance, symbols like hearts or stars might represent favorites, bookmarks, or ratings, leading to user confusion. Accompanying icons with text labels clarifies their intended function, enhancing usability.

A study highlighted by Steve McCarthy demonstrated that when users were presented with common icons without labels, they struggled to accurately identify their meanings. This underscores the importance of text labels in ensuring users understand an icon's purpose.

However, it's worth noting that in interfaces where users have become highly familiar with specific icons, the absence of labels might not hinder usability and could even streamline the interface. Yet, for broader audiences and especially in diverse contexts, combining icons with text labels is advisable to minimize ambiguity and enhance user experience.

In summary, while icons can enhance the aesthetic appeal and efficiency of an interface, pairing them with text labels ensures clarity and improves overall usability.

**Effectiveness of Buttons with Icons & Labels: A Comparative Usability Analysis**

**Summary**

Buttons in user interfaces can be presented with **icons and text labels**, with **icons alone**, or with **text labels alone**. Usability studies consistently show that combining an icon **and** a text label tends to yield the best overall results for most users. In general, **icon+label buttons reduce ambiguity**, help users perform tasks with **fewer errors**, and are **preferred by a majority of users**. Icon-only buttons may sometimes allow quick recognition if the icon is very familiar, but they often **suffer in clarity**, leading to slower task completion or mistakes when users misinterpret the symbol. Text-only buttons are usually clear but lack the quick visual cue and aesthetic appeal that icons can provide. Overall, **buttons that include both an icon and a label strike the optimal balance** – providing a visual anchor and explicit meaning – resulting in **better efficiency, accuracy, satisfaction, and accessibility** across diverse user groups. The detailed findings below, drawn from peer-reviewed research and authoritative UX sources, support this conclusion.

**Task Completion Time and Efficiency**

How quickly can users find and click the correct button? Research on task timing and efficiency has explored whether icons speed up recognition or if labels improve findability. Key findings include:

* **Icons can be fast – if immediately recognized.** In certain contexts where users could quickly identify the symbol, icon-only buttons led to slightly faster selection times. For example, an eye-tracking study found that a grid of icons _without text labels_ was selected quickest, suggesting that when icons are easily recognized and arranged efficiently (in a familiar matrix layout), they can minimize search time. This indicates icons have the potential to facilitate rapid visual scanning.
* **Ambiguous icons slow users down.** When an icon’s meaning isn’t obvious, users hesitate or spend extra time figuring it out. In such cases, a text label greatly **reduces cognitive load** by immediately conveying the function. Nielsen Norman Group emphasizes that nearly all icons are ambiguous without context – even a slight variation or a less-common symbol can confuse users. In usability tests, users often had to **“ponder” the meaning of unlabeled icons**, increasing interaction time. Thus, any speed advantage of icons disappears if users have to decipher them.
* **Combined icon+text designs perform as well as or better than either alone.** Empirical tests generally show that adding a label to an icon does not significantly hurt efficiency – and can sometimes improve it. In one study comparing a text-only UI, an icon-only UI, and an icon+text UI, the **overall task completion times were very similar** for all three. The median time to finish a set of tasks was \~78 seconds with text-only buttons, \~76 seconds with icons-only, and \~93.5 seconds with combined buttons – differences that were **not statistically significant**. This suggests that, on average, users were **not slower** when using the combined format. In fact, any slight delay from reading the text is often offset by increased confidence in choosing the right option.
* **Efficiency gains for icon+label in complex or novel tasks.** When tasks are more complex or when users are unfamiliar with the interface, having both icon and label can streamline the process. Users don’t waste time second-guessing the button’s purpose – the icon draws attention and the label confirms it. Particularly in navigation menus, showing text alongside icons from the start (instead of hiding labels in tooltips or on hover) prevents extra interactions and makes navigation more efficient.
* **Older users benefit from labels for speed.** Studies on older adults show that they locate functions much faster when icons are accompanied by text. One experiment with seniors (including some with mild cognitive impairment) found they **performed best when using icons** **_with_** **text**, and had **difficulty and slower times with icon-only buttons**. This implies that for certain demographics (older users), icon+label isn’t just equally efficient – it’s **significantly more efficient** than icons alone.

**Bottom Line – Time/Efficiency:** For familiar symbols and experienced users, icons can be quick to recognize, but in most cases, adding a text label does not slow users down and often prevents delays caused by confusion. **Icon+label buttons support rapid discovery** by combining a visual cue with immediate clarity, helping users complete tasks **quickly and confidently**.

**User Error Rates**

This section examines how each button style affects **mistakes** – e.g., clicking the wrong button, missing a function, or misusing a feature due to misunderstanding the button’s meaning.

* **Icons-only interfaces often yield more errors due to misinterpretation.** Without labels, users are left to guess an icon’s meaning, which can lead to wrong choices. Research shows that people frequently **misidentify unlabeled icons**. For example, a classic study found that users could **name only \~6 toolbar icons in Microsoft Word** after regular use, often confusing many others. Another anecdotal finding: one user thought the standard “save” icon (a floppy disk) was a **TV set**, illustrating how easily symbols can be mis-read. Such misunderstandings can cause errors (clicking an unintended action) or cause users to avoid using the icon at all (fearing an unknown outcome). In real-world usage, **critical functions were overlooked** until labels were added – for instance, early versions of MS Outlook had an icon-only toolbar that most non-expert users completely ignored (effectively an error of omission) because they didn’t understand the icons.
* **Text-only buttons have low interpretation error, but other error types may occur.** With a clear text label, users rarely misunderstand the function – “Nothing says ‘save’ like the word ‘Save’.” Misclicks due to ambiguity are minimized. However, text-only interfaces might be slower to scan, which could lead to skipping over an option accidentally if the user is skimming too fast. In general, though, **labels by themselves are very reliable** for communicating function, leading to fewer selection mistakes than icons-alone in most cases.
* **Icons** **_with_** **labels achieve the lowest error rates.** The combination provides redundancy: if the icon alone might mislead, the label corrects it. Conversely, if users don’t read the full label, the familiar shape or color of the icon can catch their eye as a hint. Numerous usability experts advocate icon+text as a best practice to reduce errors. Adding labels to the previously ignored Outlook toolbar icons caused a **total turnaround in usage** – suddenly “everyone at all skill levels started using them” correctly. This indicates that the labels eliminated the confusion (users now understood what each button did), effectively **removing the prior errors** in usage. In another example, a UI improvement study reported that simply introducing text labels next to icons **“immediately fixed the usability issues”**, and people stopped clicking the wrong toolbar buttons. In summary, icon+label designs tend to be **self-explanatory**, so users rarely choose the wrong control or overlook features, dramatically reducing error rates compared to icon-only designs.
* **Early studies showed icons could equal or surpass text in accuracy** **_after_** **learning.** It’s worth noting that in controlled lab conditions where users had a predefined set of well-designed symbols, icons alone sometimes matched or even beat text in error rates. For example, one early experiment (Remington & Williams, 1986) found that participants made **fewer errors with icons** than with text labels in a visual search task. However, this scenario presumed users had effectively learned what each icon meant or the icons were very intuitive. In practical, everyday software use, such ideal conditions rarely hold. Outside the lab, users are confronted with many abstract icons and no training – under those circumstances, **text labels are far safer to prevent errors**. Modern consensus is that _unless_ your icons are as obvious as “trash can = delete” or “printer = print,” relying on icon alone risks user mistakes.
* **Tooltips (hover text) are a fallback, not a fix.** Interfaces sometimes try to mitigate icon ambiguity by showing a text tooltip on hover (or long-press). While this can help reduce errors by eventually revealing the label, it’s not a substitute for a visible label. First, users have to hover each icon to find out what it does, essentially _trial-and-error_. This slows them down and still causes initial errors. Secondly, on touch devices or for less tech-savvy users, hover tooltips may not be discovered at all. Experts caution that **“your users shouldn’t have to grope around for tooltips”** – the fact that text labels never need such hover help is a strong indicator that **text is inherently clearer**. Therefore, to minimize errors, it’s best to show the label outright rather than hiding it.

**Bottom Line – Errors:** Relying on icon-only buttons often increases the risk of user errors (wrong clicks or missed options) because of ambiguity. **Text labels dramatically cut down interpretation errors**, and when paired with icons, they virtually eliminate confusion in identifying the button’s function. The icon+label format is the most error-resistant, especially important for critical functions where mistakes carry a cost.

**User Satisfaction and Preference**

User satisfaction refers to how much users **like** the interface and their subjective comfort/confidence using it. Preferences often come out in usability studies via surveys, interviews, or usability scores. Here’s what research says about how users _feel_ about icons vs text:

* **Clarity drives satisfaction.** Users tend to be happiest when they can **easily understand** the interface. Unsurprisingly, interfaces that caused confusion (often icon-only setups) led to frustration. Many users report disliking interfaces where they have to guess what symbols mean. _“Good UI should always be clear,”_ as one user put it – when faced with apps that use icons without labels, people often resort to random tapping and feel less satisfied. On the other hand, when buttons are clearly labeled (icon+text or text-only), users feel more in control and confident, which boosts satisfaction.
* **Combined icon & text interfaces are often rated highest.** When asked for preferences, users frequently choose the design that has both icons and labels as the most user-friendly. In a comparative usability study where participants tried all three styles, the **icon+label interface achieved the highest System Usability Scale (SUS) scores** (a standardized usability satisfaction metric). Specifically, the combined design scored around 91/100 (which is an “excellent” grade), compared to about 85 for text-only and much lower (\~75 or below) for icons-only. This indicates that users _perceived_ the icon+label version to be easiest and most effective. Even though the text-only version was also quite usable, people felt more satisfied with the added icons, and the icon-only version trailed far behind in perceived usability.
* **Icons enhance subjective appeal (when paired with text).** Visually, users often enjoy the presence of icons – they add color and interest, breaking up what might otherwise be monotony of text. Interfaces with icons are often described as more **“engaging” and easier to scan**, because the graphics draw the eye to key options. However, this positive effect on **aesthetic satisfaction** only holds if the icons don’t introduce confusion. With a label present, users get the benefit of the icon’s visual appeal **without the downside of ambiguity**, resulting in a generally positive impression. Research has noted that users sometimes _believe_ an application is easier to use when it has accompanying icons, **even if their actual task performance doesn’t improve** – a phenomenon observed by Wiedenbeck (1999). In that study, participants felt the icon+text interface was more “comfortable” to learn, likely because it looked friendly and informative, though their success rates were similar to the text-only interface. This indicates a psychological benefit: **users simply like when an interface uses helpful visuals**, as long as they are explanatory.
* **Preference varies with context, but icon+text wins as a safe default.** Users’ preferences can depend on their goals. For quick repetitive actions, some expert users _say_ they prefer icon-only toolbars (once they’ve learned them) because it’s compact. But for any new or infrequent tasks, the **majority of users voice a preference for having a label** visible. They often cite reasons like “I don’t want to memorize what the icon means” or “the text makes it obvious.” In design surveys and A/B tests, **most users choose the labeled icons as their favored design**, finding it “clear and visually pleasing.” It strikes a balance – pure text might be seen as boring or harder to scan, while pure icons feel cryptic; the combination is both attractive and understandable.
* **Lower cognitive workload with icon+label.** User satisfaction is closely tied to how much mental effort it takes to use the interface. A study measuring **NASA-TLX (task load index)** found that the interface heavily reliant on icons had the **highest mental workload** reported, whereas the interface with both icons and text had the _lowest_ (users found it least demanding). When users don’t have to puzzle out meanings, it reduces stress. Participants also commented that they felt more at ease when they could confirm an icon’s meaning by reading a caption, as opposed to icon-only where they felt they had to **remember or guess**, which can be stressful. This reduced mental effort translates to higher subjective satisfaction.

**Bottom Line – Satisfaction:** Users overwhelmingly prefer interfaces that are **both easy to understand and visually helpful**. Buttons with both icons and labels hit that sweet spot – they are generally liked for being clear, confidence-inspiring, and aesthetically pleasing. Icon-only buttons often frustrate users (unless they’re experts), whereas text-only buttons, while clear, might not delight visually. Combining text with icons leads to the **highest satisfaction and is most often the users’ choice** when asked for their preferred style.

**Accessibility Considerations**

Accessibility ensures that interfaces are usable by people with **disabilities or limitations**, including those using assistive technologies (like screen readers), people with visual impairments, cognitive impairments, etc. When comparing icon vs text vs both, there are important accessibility implications:

* **Screen reader compatibility:** Text labels on buttons are immediately accessible to screen readers (software that reads out UI elements for blind or low-vision users). An icon by itself is essentially an image; **if no text label is present, developers must provide an alternative text (“aria-label” or similar)** so that screen readers can announce what the icon does. This is a requirement of accessibility standards (WCAG Success Criterion 1.1.1: non-text content must have a text alternative). In practice, when an icon has a visible label next to it, that label typically serves as the accessible name for the button – a robust solution. With icon-only buttons, there’s a risk that if the alternative text is missing or poorly written, the button will be announced as just “button” or something vague, making the interface unusable to blind users. Thus, **icon+text is the safest choice to meet accessibility guidelines**, as the text is built-in and always available to assistive tech.
* **Visual impairments and low vision:** Users with low vision often zoom in or use screen magnifiers. A text label will generally scale well (especially if the UI uses responsive text). Icons might not scale as clearly, or could pixellate, and if someone can only see part of the screen at high zoom, an unfamiliar icon might not be recognizable. Moreover, some users have difficulty perceiving detail or color – a small icon might not be distinguishable (e.g., a thin-lined icon might just look like a smudge). For these users, a textual label is crucial. **Color-blind users** also benefit from labels – for instance, an icon that relies on color coding (like a red versus green symbol) could be indistinguishable to them, but a label will clarify the action regardless of color. Providing both modalities (icon shape and text) improves the chances that at least one will be clear if the other is missed.
* **Cognitive and learning disabilities:** Icons can be cognitively challenging – they are essentially a visual language one must learn. Users with certain cognitive disabilities, dyslexia, or memory issues might find it hard to remember what a given icon represents, especially if it’s abstract. A text label, on the other hand, can be read (or heard via assistive tech) in the user’s own language, reducing cognitive decoding effort. Research involving users with mild cognitive impairment showed that adding text to icons significantly improved their ability to identify the correct function. Similarly, autistic users or those with attention disorders often prefer explicit instructions (text) over symbolic ones; a label can help focus them on the task by **removing ambiguity**. Overall, icon+text is considered more cognitively accessible because it does not rely solely on symbolic interpretation.
* **Motor and dexterity considerations:** If a user has motor impairments and is using switch controls or voice commands to navigate, having clear labels to target can be important. Voice control software often lets a user say the name of a button. If the button is only an icon with no accessible label, the user might not know what word to say (or there might not be a proper name to speak). With visible text, they can simply say that text. For switch or keyboard-only users, tabbing through controls, hearing a meaningful label read aloud is critical to know when they’ve focused the right button. Icon-only buttons can slow down or hinder these navigation methods if not labeled properly.
* **Avoiding hover-dependent labels for accessibility:** Some designs hide the text label and only show it on hover (tooltip). This is **problematic for accessibility** on multiple fronts. Firstly, hover doesn’t exist for touch-screen users (mobile or tablet), so those users might never see the label at all. Secondly, users with limited dexterity may find it difficult to hover accurately on small icons. And thirdly, as noted, screen readers don’t trigger hover tooltips by default; they rely on the underlying accessible name. Nielsen Norman Group explicitly advises that **icon labels should be visible at all times and not only on hover**, as hiding them “reduces the efficacy” and fails on touch devices. In short, **permanently visible text** is much more accessible than text that only appears on mouse hover.
* **User control and customization:** As an accessibility enhancement, some applications provide a setting to switch between icon-only, text-only, or both. This allows users to choose what works best for them – for instance, a visually impaired user might turn on “text labels on icons” mode if an app somehow defaulted to icons only. Experts suggest that if an interface must use icon-only buttons (perhaps due to space constraints), it’s good to at least allow an option for text labels (or an “accessible mode”). However, the need for such options can be avoided entirely by simply using icons with labels by default for everyone.

**Bottom Line – Accessibility:** Buttons that include both an icon and a text label are the most **inclusive**. They inherently provide textual information for screen readers and clarity for users with visual or cognitive impairments, while still offering a visual cue. Icon-only buttons require extra care (and technical workarounds) to be accessible and still often confuse many users with disabilities. Text-only is accessible to many, but might not serve those with limited literacy or where a visual cue could help. **Icon+label ensures that multiple senses/abilities can be engaged (visual symbol, readable text, speakable name), covering the widest range of needs.** This makes icon+text buttons the best practice from an accessibility standpoint.

**Effectiveness Across Different Demographics**

Users are not a monolith – age, experience, and background can dramatically influence how someone perceives icons vs text. Here we examine how different groups respond to icon-only, text-only, or combined buttons:

* **Older Adults:** Aging can bring declining vision, memory, and cognitive speed. **Studies consistently find older users benefit from text labels on icons.** In a test of adults aged 65+, participants struggled with modern flat icons but performed much better when those icons had accompanying text. The addition of text not only improved accuracy but also narrowed the gap between those with cognitive impairment and those without – meaning labels helped even users with memory issues understand the icons almost as well as their healthier peers. Seniors often express a preference for **“words with pictures”** because they grew up in an era of text menus and may not recognize newer iconography. An icon that younger people know (like a hamburger menu ☰ for navigation) might not be obvious to a senior user, but writing “Menu” beside it makes it clear. Thus, for older demographics, icon+label is markedly more effective. (If forced to choose one, many experts would even choose **text-only for seniors** over icons-only, because misinterpreting an icon is worse than having no icon at all in that group.)
* **Younger Users:** Younger demographics (teens, young adults) are generally more tech-savvy and have grown up with digital iconography. They may recognize common icons faster and sometimes enjoy icon-heavy designs. For example, a teenager might instantly know a heart icon means “Like/Favorite” because of social media convention. However, it’s a mistake to assume _all_ icons are understood by all young people. If an icon is novel or not mainstream, younger users can be just as confused as older ones. The difference is younger users might be a bit more willing to explore or trial-and-error with icons. Even so, research has shown that **for unfamiliar tasks, young users also perform best with icon+text** initially, until they learn the icons. In summary: for very common actions (like play, pause, home) younger users do fine with icons, but for anything else, providing a label is still more effective to ensure understanding.
* **Novice vs. Experienced Users:** **User experience level** with a given interface or with computers in general heavily influences what works best:  
   * **Novices (Inexperienced Users):** People new to an application or with limited tech experience find text labels **much easier to learn**. An empirical study by Wiedenbeck (1999) showed that end-users learned an application’s functions better when the buttons had text labels than when they had only icons. The group using text-labeled controls had higher accuracy and retention when tested later on what the buttons did. Icon-only learners struggled unless the icons were very intuitive or they received training. For a novice, every unknown icon is essentially a secret code they must crack, whereas a label is plain language. Thus, to onboard new users smoothly, icon+label is ideal (or at least text-only). Novices also tend to **prefer having both** – it gives them confidence that they are clicking the right thing. They are less likely to experiment blindly, so a clear label encourages them to use features  
   * **Experts (Power Users):** Users who are very familiar with an interface can operate faster with toolbars and may rely less on reading labels. Interestingly, studies like the UIE icon research found that expert users often stop “seeing” the icon details after a while and rely on **muscle memory or spatial memory**–they know the save button is the third from the left, for instance. For these users, icons alone might suffice because they’ve internalized them. However, including text doesn’t hurt experts – they can simply ignore the label and still click by position. Meanwhile, the labels remain available if the expert ever forgets an icon (which can happen if they don’t use a feature often). So, combined buttons cater to experts and novices at once. Experts aren’t slowed down by the presence of text (they might not even consciously notice it), and novices are supported. Notably, when Microsoft switched Outlook’s interface from icon-only to icon+text, **even experts didn’t complain**–many actually discovered features they hadn’t used before, and new users were finally able to use the toolbar. This demonstrates that icon+text can serve a broad spectrum of experience levels effectively.
* **Cultural and Language Differences:** In international or multicultural user groups, icons and text have different advantages. Icons are sometimes touted as “language-independent,” but in reality **cultural context matters** for icon interpretation. An icon that makes sense in one country might perplex users in another (for example, a mailbox icon might signify email in the U.S., but if a culture doesn’t use mailboxes of that style, the metaphor could fail). **Text labels allow proper translation and localization**, ensuring users know the function in their own language. The safest route in global products is to use a **familiar icon + translated label**. This way, users get a hint from the icon (which might be somewhat recognizable, like a shopping cart for “cart” or a magnifying glass for “search”) and confirmation from the text in their language. Studies in cross-cultural usability note that relying on icons alone can introduce misunderstandings; for instance, one study pointed out that because **there is no universal standard for most icons**, their meaning “is based on previous experience” and can vary. Providing text with the icon eliminates that cultural guesswork. Additionally, in languages that use non-Latin scripts, some users actually prefer recognizable icons alongside text because it adds a visual cue that might be quicker to pick up than reading a foreign script. Either way, the combination is effective across language barriers.
* **Educational background and literacy:** Users with lower literacy may struggle with text labels, so one might think icons would help – and they can, to an extent, by providing a picture. However, if someone cannot read well, they also might not comprehend abstract icons. For these users, using **very clear icons plus a simple label** (potentially an opportunity for dual coding of information) is beneficial. For example, an e-government kiosk for a population with mixed literacy levels might show an icon of a house _and_ the word “Home” – the picture helps those who can’t read well, and the word confirms for those who can. Research in education and UX suggests that _redundant cues_ (image + text) help comprehension for all literacy levels. So across educational demographics, combining them covers all bases.

**Bottom Line – Demographics:** **Icons with labels prove to be the most universally effective across diverse user groups.** Older adults and novices, who are most vulnerable to confusion, strongly prefer and perform best with icon+text buttons. Younger and expert users may be comfortable with some icon-only buttons, but they do not significantly suffer from the presence of labels – and in unfamiliar situations, they too benefit from the clarity. Cross-cultural users require labels for accurate translation of meaning, with icons acting as helpful supplements. In sum, designing buttons with both icons and text ensures that **users of all ages, backgrounds, and skill levels can intuitively understand and use the interface**.

**Conclusion**

**Definitive Conclusion:** Based on extensive usability research and empirical studies, **buttons that include both an icon and a text label are the most effective overall**. They combine the strengths of both approaches: the quick visual recognition of an icon plus the unambiguous explanation of a text label. This synergy leads to better outcomes in all key areas:

* **Efficiency:** Icon+label buttons allow users to find and use functions quickly with minimal hesitation. In most cases, users complete tasks as fast or faster than with icons-only or text-only designs, especially when the icon by itself might have caused a second of doubt.
* **Accuracy:** The addition of a label virtually eliminates interpretation errors. Users make fewer mistakes clicking the wrong button or missing a feature, as the label clarifies the icon’s intent.
* **User Satisfaction:** Users consistently report higher confidence and satisfaction with combined labels. They feel the interface is easier and more pleasant to use, since they don’t need to guess meanings and still enjoy the visual cues.
* **Accessibility:** Icon+text ensures the interface is accessible to the widest audience. It inherently meets accessibility guidelines and accommodates users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive challenges by providing multiple forms of information (visual and textual).
* **Universality:** Across demographics – young or old, expert or novice, any language – the combination format adapts to the user’s needs. It aids those who need the extra help while not hindering those who might not. In design, this is a inclusive solution that avoids one-size-fits-few pitfalls.

In contrast, **icon-only buttons are a high-risk, high-ambiguity choice** in many contexts. They should be reserved only for cases where space is extremely limited or the icon is truly standard and obvious to _all_ users (e.g., a trash can for “delete”). Even then, a tooltip or explanation should be provided to guard against confusion. **Text-only buttons are certainly usable** and clear, but they miss out on the quick scanning benefits and aesthetic enhancements that icons can provide.

Ultimately, the evidence leads to a clear recommendation: **whenever feasible, label your icons**. The combination of icons and labels on buttons yields the most **efficient, error-free, and user-approved experience**. By prioritizing clarity and understanding (through text) while leveraging visual cues (through icons), designers can ensure their interfaces are both **usable and delightful**. Thus, buttons with icons _and_ labels are generally the optimal choice for effective UI design.

**Considerations for Hokkaido's Snow Conditions:**

* **Powder Snow:** Hokkaido is famous for its light, dry powder. Boards with a wider nose and rocker profiles can enhance floatation in deep snow.
* **Temperature:** The region experiences cold temperatures, which keep the snow light and fluffy. Ensure your gear, including outerwear and gloves, is suitable for low temperatures.
* **Local Brands:** Japanese brands like Gentemstick and Moss Snowstick design boards specifically for local conditions, offering performance advantages in Hokkaido's unique snow.

When selecting a snowboard, consider demoing different models if possible to find the best fit for your riding style and the specific conditions you'll encounter.

## Deep research

I’m looking for the perfect snowboard. I will be riding primarily in Hokkaido around twice a month during the winter season. I enjoy groomed runs but also want a board that can handle some fresh powder on occasion. I prefer a versatile all-mountain or freestyle board with a medium flex, something that’s stable for carving yet maneuverable in variable conditions. I want something with a fresh, citrus color palette that will pop on the slopes. My budget is mid-range to slightly premium, and I’d like suggestions on specific brands and models that are accessible in Japan. Please explain why each recommended board suits my requirements. Also, include any tips or considerations for riding in Hokkaido’s unique snow conditions. Include images of the items and format it in an easy to read table.

**Choosing a Snowboard for Hokkaido:** In Hokkaido’s deep, dry snow and well-groomed runs, a versatile all-mountain or freestyle board with medium flex is ideal. Such boards blend **stability for carving** on piste with enough **float and agility** for occasional powder stashes. A bright, “citrus” color scheme will also help you stand out against the snow. Below are some top mid-range to premium recommendations (all from brands readily available in Japan), each meeting those criteria. We include images and key specs for comparison, followed by Hokkaido-specific riding tips.

The Typo is built_“for the dedicated resort rat…who loved the Basic but wanted a faster base and a little more snap”_. It features MidBite™ edge cut-outs that narrow the board waist, enhancing edge-to-edge quickness and adding extra bite underfoot for carving. That translates to confident turns on Hokkaido corduroy and control on occasional icy patches. A slight taper and setback stance give it better nose lift in powder. It’s an easy-going yet responsive ride –_versatile, stable, and poppy_, excelling in groomers, trees and occasional park laps.**Design:**The Typo’s topsheet art (by Guillaume Rousseaux) is a vibrant, playful collage on a teal/blue background – not overtly “citrus,” but still bright and distinctive on the hill.                                                                                                   |

GNU designed this award-winner for all-mountain fun – it’s_“an asym design…combining asymmetry, slightly wider widths that rail and float, with C2 contours that pop, carve and lift”_. In practice, that means**smooth, intuitive turning**(deeper heel-side sidecut on the asym twin makes carving heelside feel easier and more precise) and excellent edge grip thanks to Magne-Traction® serrated edges (great for gripping through variable or tracked-out snow). The mild rocker between the feet adds a bit of surfy looseness and float in powder, while camber underfoot preserves stability and pop for jumps. This board shines on Hokkaido’s terrain – it’s forgiving enough for playful powder runs and tree lines, yet holds an edge on wind-packed groomers. GNU’s eco-sublimated top and bright base (varies by size; often featuring bold logos or art) will ensure your board_doesn’t blend in_– the black edition has big white GNU letters, and some variants include neon graphics. |

**Hokkaido Riding Tips:** Hokkaido’s famed powder is ultra light and plentiful, so even on groomed runs you may encounter a layer of fresh snow. To maximize fun and safety:

* **Set Your Stance Back on Deep Days:** If heavy snowfall is expected, consider using setback inserts (or a longer board) for extra nose float. Many all-mountain boards (like the Assassin and Typo) have optional setback stance positions or taper that help in powder – take advantage of them for knee-deep days.
* **Wax for Cold, Dry Snow:** Hokkaido’s temperatures are cold. A cold-temperature or all-temperature wax will keep your board gliding smoothly on dry powder. A well-waxed sintered base (featured on most of the boards above) will prevent drag in the ultra-dry snow.
* **Leverage the Board’s Tech:** The boards recommended come with tech for variable conditions – e.g. use the Magne-Traction or MidBite edges to carve confidently even if you hit the occasional icy patch or wind-scoured hardpack. These features bite into firm snow, giving you stability when carving groomers.
* **Visibility and Identification:** A bright, high-contrast board graphic isn’t just stylish – it helps your friends spot you in tree runs and makes it easier to find your board if it gets unintentionally “tomahawked” into deep snow. The citrus-inspired colors on these boards can be a real plus in Hokkaido’s frequent white-out storms.
* **Enjoy the Float:** Even with an all-mountain twin, you’ll notice Hokkaido’s powder is easier to ride than heavier snow elsewhere. Still, keep your weight slightly back in deeper sections and carry speed through flats. The rocker tips and medium flex of these boards will make surfing through Sapporo’s famous fluff feel natural and fun.

Finally, all these boards are built to handle **variable terrain** – from Niseko’s gentle groomers to Furano’s tree runs – so you can confidently explore. With the right board underfoot, Hokkaido’s unique snow will truly shine. **Enjoy the ride!Sources:** Snowboard specifications and tech descriptions from official brand info and reviews; Flex ratings, shape and camber details per manufacturer specs; Hokkaido conditions noted by rider reports and climate data (e.g. extremely high snowfall with dry powder).

What’s the average retirement age for NFL kickers?

Determining the exact average retirement age for NFL kickers is challenging due to variations in individual careers and the lack of comprehensive data. However, kickers generally enjoy longer careers compared to other positions in the NFL. The average career length for kickers and punters is approximately 4.87 years, which is notably higher than the league-wide average of 3.3 years.

In terms of age, the average NFL kicker is around 29 years old. Many kickers continue playing into their late 30s and even early 40s. For instance, as of 2024, Nick Folk and Matt Prater were both active at 40 years old.

Given these figures, it's reasonable to infer that the average retirement age for NFL kickers falls between 35 and 40 years old, allowing for individual differences in performance, health, and team needs.

What’s the average retirement age for nfl kickers

NFL kickers tend to retire significantly later than most other players. While the **average NFL player retires around age 27–28** due to the league’s physical toll, kickers often play well beyond 30\. In fact, kickers have the longest careers on average of any position – roughly **4.8 seasons on average**, compared to about 3.3 for all players (running backs average only \~2.5). Starting their careers in their early 20s, an “average” kicker might retire around _age 30_. However, it’s very common for successful NFL kickers to continue into their late 30s and even their 40s. A reliable, productive kicker can stick around for _two decades_ in the league.

**Range:** On the low end, some kickers see their careers end in their 20s if they struggle or are replaced by younger competition. But at the high end, kickers are the ones who often push the boundaries of age in the NFL. Many of the **oldest players in NFL history have been kickers.** For example, **George Blanda** (who was also a quarterback) retired at _48 years old_, the oldest ever. The next-oldest were all placekickers: **Morten Andersen** retired at _47_, and **John Carney** and **Adam Vinatieri** each played until _46_. It’s not unusual to see active kickers around 40; in 2025, two NFL kickers (Nick Folk and Matt Prater) were 40 years old. By contrast, players at high-contact positions (like running back or linebacker) rarely last past their early 30s.

**Why kickers last longer:** The main reason is that the _physical demands_ of kicking are lower than other positions. Kickers aren’t subject to bone-crunching hits on every play. As one analysis notes, due to “**less physical contact, positions like kickers (and quarterbacks) typically have longer careers**” than collision-heavy positions. With fewer traumatic injuries and less wear-and-tear, a kicker’s body can hold up longer. Also, kicking is a specialized skill that relies more on technique, accuracy, and leg strength than on the raw speed or all-around athleticism that declines rapidly with age. Many kickers can maintain their leg power and refine their technique well into their late 30s or 40s.

Of course, kickers aren’t immune to aging. They do eventually experience diminishing leg strength or accuracy, which can prompt retirement. For instance, even legends like Vinatieri (the NFL’s all-time scoring leader) hung up the cleats once their performance started slipping in their mid-40s. Some kickers also decide to retire if they lose their job and opportunities dry up – effectively being “forced out” in their 20s or 30s despite not being physically broken. And on rare occasions, a kicker might retire early by choice (e.g. to pursue other careers or due to a persistent injury), though this is less common than at other positions.

In summary, **NFL kickers enjoy unusual longevity**. Many retire in their **mid-to-late 30s** – considerably later than the overall NFL average. It’s not uncommon for a top kicker to play 15+ years and _approach age 40_ before retiring. A handful of outliers have even kicked into their mid-40s. This longevity comes from the position’s lower physical strain and the fact that as long as a kicker stays accurate and effective, teams will keep him around. Meanwhile, the high-contact roles see careers end much sooner. As one sports writer put it, a dependable kicker can be in the NFL “**for upwards of two decades**,” whereas players taking the biggest pounding (running backs, linemen, etc.) tend to have the _earliest_ retirements.

Deep research provides components and factors to consider, rather than just a number. It is more thorough, gives clear statistical context, uses supporting examples, and directly addresses the “why” behind kickers’ longevity relative to other positions. That level of detail and clarity makes it more informative and more directly responsive to someone wanting to understand retirement age trends in the NFL.

## How it works

Deep research was trained using end-to-end reinforcement learning on hard browsing and reasoning tasks across a range of domains. Through that training, it learned to plan and execute a multi-step trajectory to find the data it needs, backtracking and reacting to real-time information where necessary. The model is also able to browse over user uploaded files, plot and iterate on graphs using the python tool, embed both generated graphs and images from websites in its responses, and cite specific sentences or passages from its sources. As a result of this training, it reaches new highs on a number of public evaluations focused on real-world problems.

I am a researcher interested in bringing mixed-gas sorption capabilities to my lab. Please discuss the differences between pure- and mixed-gas sorption for glassy polymers, how the dual-mode sorption model can be used to predict mixed-gas sorption behavior in glassy polymers (include equations where applicable), and what challenges there are in accurately predicting pure- and mixed-gas sorption using the dual-mode sorption model. Only include open-source information as of October 1, 2024.

**Pure vs. mixed-gas sorption in glassy polymers:** In a glassy polymer (below TgT\_gTg​), a single gas typically exhibits a concave sorption isotherm: uptake rises sublinearly with pressure, unlike the linear Henry’s-law behavior above TgT\_gTg​. This is attributed to “dual-mode” sorption: some penetrant dissolves in the dense polymer matrix (obeying Henry’s law) while additional penetrant saturates specific microvoid “sites” (a Langmuir-type adsorption in the polymer’s nonequilibrium free volume). By contrast, when two or more gases are present, they **compete** for those limited Langmuir sorption sites. As a result, each component’s sorbed concentration in a mixture is generally lower than it would be at the same partial pressure alone. In particular the less soluble (lower-affinity) gas tends to be more strongly suppressed, often causing the mixed-gas _solubility selectivity_ (ratio of concentrations) to **exceed** the ideal value predicted from pure-gas isotherms. For example, in CO₂/CH₄ mixtures both components sorb less than in their pure-gas cases (especially CH₄), so the CO₂/CH₄ sorption selectivity is higher under mixture conditions. In extreme cases, mixed-gas effects can even reverse performance trends observed with single gases. (We note that unlike competitive sorption, _synergistic_ sorption – where one gas increases the sorption of another via polymer swelling – is usually minor in rigid high-free-volume polymers under moderate pressures.)

**Dual-mode sorption model and mixed-gas prediction:** The dual-mode sorption (DMS) model quantitatively captures glassy polymer sorption by superposing a Henry’s-law term and a Langmuir term. For a single gas, the sorbed concentration CCC (e.g. in cm³(STP) gas per cm³ polymer) is written as:

C(p)\=kD p + CH′ b p 1+b p .C(p) = k\_D\\,p \\;+\\; \\frac{C'\_H\\,b\\,p}{\\,1 + b\\,p\\,}\\,. C(p)\=kD​p+1+bpCH′​bp​.

Here kDk\_DkD​ is the Henry’s law coefficient for dissolution, CH′C'\_HCH′​ is the Langmuir capacity constant (proportional to the polymer’s unrelaxed free-volume or “hole” capacity), and bbb is the Langmuir affinity constant. This empirical formula yields the characteristic concave isotherm of glassy polymers and reduces to simple Henry’s law at the glass-transition (since CH′→0C'\_H \\to 0CH′​→0 as T→TgT \\to T\_gT→Tg​). The same three parameters (kD,CH′,bk\_D, C'\_H, bkD​,CH′​,b) are obtained by fitting pure-gas sorption data and are then used to predict mixture sorption. For a binary mixture of gases A and B (with partial pressures pA,pBp\_A, p\_BpA​,pB​), the DMS model assumes each gas obeys its own Henry’s term and that both compete for the same Langmuir sites. One convenient form is to write the total sorbed concentration as the sum of contributions from each gas:

Ctot\=kD,ApA+kD,BpB + CH,A′ bA pA + CH,B′ bB pB 1+bApA+bBpB ,C\_{\\text{tot}} = k\_{D,A}p\_A + k\_{D,B}p\_B \\;+\\; \\frac{\\,C'\_{H,A}\\,b\_A\\,p\_A \\;+\\; C'\_{H,B}\\,b\_B\\,p\_B\\,}{\\,1 + b\_A p\_A + b\_B p\_B\\,}\\,,Ctot​\=kD,A​pA​+kD,B​pB​+1+bA​pA​+bB​pB​CH,A′​bA​pA​+CH,B′​bB​pB​​,

which implicitly means the concentration of component _i_ in the mixture is Ci\=kD,ipi+CH,i′bipi 1+∑jbjpj C\_i = k\_{D,i} p\_i + \\frac{C'\_{H,i} b\_i p\_i}{\\,1+\\sum\_j b\_j p\_j\\,}Ci​\=kD,i​pi​+1+∑j​bj​pj​CH,i′​bi​pi​​. This reduces to the single-gas formula when the other component’s pressure is zero. In practice, partial pressure in these equations is often replaced by fugacity for accuracy at high pressures, though using fugacities or pressures gives nearly the same results if applied consistently. The DMS mixed-gas model predicts the **competitive sorption** effect observed experimentally – namely, each gas’s uptake is depressed relative to its pure-gas sorption isotherm.

**Challenges and limitations:** Although the dual-mode model is widely successful in correlating sorption data, it has notable limitations in predicting sorption behavior. First, the DMS model is empirical – its fitted parameters are _not_ universal constants but can vary with polymer formation history, physical aging, and temperature/pressure range. This means a parameter set obtained under one set of conditions may lack predictive power outside its calibration range. For instance, sorption isotherms measured only over a limited pressure range can be fit well by DMS, but extrapolating beyond that (especially approaching plasticization pressures) may be unreliable. Indeed, multiple distinct combinations of kDk\_DkD​, CH′C'\_HCH′​, bbb can sometimes fit the same pure-gas isotherm almost equally well – yet they yield markedly different mixed-gas predictions. This sensitivity undermines confidence in mixture forecasts, as one study showed that using different pure-gas fit sets led to only _qualitative_ agreement with some mixed-CO₂/CH₄ data.

Furthermore, DMS inherently assumes a fixed population of Langmuir sites (microvoids) and ignores polymer relaxation or swelling induced by sorbate. In reality, penetrant-induced swelling (plasticization) can increase free volume and sorption capacity, especially for highly condensable gases at high activity – an effect the basic DMS model cannot capture. In binary sorption, this means any **synergistic** increase in sorption due to a second gas (or due to polymer dilation) is unaccounted for in the standard model. Conversely, the model also cannot describe sorption isotherm shapes that deviate from concave Langmuir-type behavior (e.g. sigmoidal isotherms caused by specific polymer-penetrant interactions or clustering). For example, glassy polymers absorbing polar molecules like alcohols can show sigmoidal sorption isotherms, which the simple dual-mode framework fails to represent. Finally, accurately measuring mixed-gas sorption itself is challenging, and discrepancies between idealized model assumptions (e.g. truly zero downstream pressure, no competitive diffusion limitations) and experimental realities can add to prediction error. Despite these challenges, the dual-mode sorption model – with appropriate care – remains a valuable first approximation for interpreting sorption in glassy polymers, and it highlights the key role of competitive site occupancy in mixed-gas environments. Researchers often turn to more elaborate models (e.g. non-equilibrium lattice fluid or thermodynamic theories) when the dual-mode model’s assumptions break down, but such models come at the cost of additional parameters or complexity. In summary, dual-mode sorption provides a useful baseline for pure- and mixed-gas sorption in glassy polymers, but one must be mindful of its empirical nature and the above limitations when predicting multicomponent sorption behavior in practice.

Time saved on task: 5 hours

I am a linguist and was hired by a film production company. They want me to write some dialogues in English of 5 centuries later. Since in the movie the US is invaded by different nations with very different languages, English becomes a creole language, borrowing certain characteristics of each language. I want you to translate the sentences in (1) into this creole which has the features in (2).

(1) a. The cat is in the room.  
b. The men loaded the truck with hay.  
c. The dogs are barking.  
d. What did you say that Mary buy?  
e. Some rat ate the cheese.  
f. I want a sweeter dish.  
g. The most beautiful homes have been sold.  
h. He could come earlier.

(2) a. English becomes a split ergative language based on 'verb type'. If the verb is intransitive, the Subject bears Nominative Case, and if the verb is transitive, the Subject bears Ergative Case and the Object bears Absolutive Case. Case markers are borrowed from Hindi.

b. The word order of English also changes. It is a verb final language: SOV

c. Articles (a/an/the), modal and auxiliary verbs (may, should, must, etc.) and prepositions (in, at, on, etc) are prefixes. If more then one of them occur together, they can be prefixed as a cluster to the first content word in the phrase: 'on a barn' --> 'onabarn'

d. In wh-questions, the wh-phrase is pronounced at the beginning of a sentence, in its base position and also at the beginning of each clause in between (I am ignoring other changes such as word order, ergativity etc.):

"Which cake did you say which cake Mary cooked which cake?"

e. Expletive 'there' can be used with transitive verbs as long as the Subject is indefinite, as in Icelandic.

f. Comparative forms of adjectives are derived via partial reduplication: the first consonant + the first vowel of the adjective/adverb is copied and added to the adjective/adverb as a prefix. If the adjective starts with a vowel, 'm' is added in between the vowel and the adjective/adverb. If the adjective/adverb starts with a consonant cluster , the last consonant in the cluster + the first vowel is copied, e.g. 'more beautiful' --> 'bebeautiful' (for such reduplication, you cal look into emphatic reduplication of adjectives in Turkish)

g. Superlative forms of adjectives are derived via doubling: the adjective/adverb is reduplicated, e.g. 'the shortest' --> 'short short'

While applying the processes in (2), keep in mind that from Hindi this creole borrows only case markers, nothing else. For each process listed in (2), do research on each and provide at least one academic resource. If a language is specified (such as Hindi, Icelandic), do research on the relevant process in that specific language. For each sentence in (1), explain your thought and translation process.

Please prepare the doc in txt format. Use online sources (e.g., journal papers, dissertations, books, book chapters, conference papers, abstracts, etc.) available before October, 5 2024\. Provide in-text citations to academic sources as appropriate and provide a reference list WITH HYPERLINKS TO EACH SOURCE CITED at the very end.

**Split Ergativity and Hindi Case Markers (2a):** The future creole uses an **ergative–absolutive alignment**: transitive clauses mark the subject with an ergative case and the object with absolutive case, whereas intransitive subjects carry nominative (absolutive) case. This mirrors Hindi’s split-ergative system (by aspect), where **\-ne** marks transitive subjects (ergative) and unmarked nouns serve as absolutive/nominative. Hindi also has a particle **\-ko** for specific objects (accusative/dative). We borrow these case markers (and **only** these from Hindi). For example, Hindi “Ram=**ne** kitab kharida” (“Ram-ERG bought a book”) marks “Ram” with _\-ne_. In our creole, a transitive subject likewise takes _\-ne_, and (optionally) a definite object takes _\-ko_ (if specific), while intransitive subjects remain unmarked (absolutive). This split by verb type (transitive vs intransitive) is a hallmark of ergative alignment. We see similar patterns in many ergative languages (e.g. Basque, Hindi, etc.), where the sole argument of an intransitive behaves like the object of a transitive.

**Verb-Final Word Order (2b):** The creole’s syntax has shifted to **SOV (Subject–Object–Verb)** order, meaning the verb comes last in a clause. SOV is cross-linguistically very common (the single most frequent basic order) and is found in languages that likely influence this creole (e.g. Hindi, Turkish, Japanese are SOV). Adopting SOV, our examples will place the verb or verb cluster at the end of the sentence. This change aligns English with a typologically prevalent pattern.

**Cliticized Articles, Auxiliaries/Modals, and Prepositions (2c):** Functional words like **definite/indefinite articles** (“the, a”), **auxiliary or modal verbs** (“is, have, may, could”), and **prepositions** (“in, on, with”, etc.) become **proclitic prefixes** attached to the following content word. In other words, these normally separate words are phonologically bound to the content word they modify. Linguistically, these elements behave like **clitics** – prosodically weak function words (articles, prepositions, auxiliaries, etc.) that must attach to a host. If multiple such clitics occur in a row, they form a **cluster** prefixed to the first content word of that phrase. This is analogous to how, for example, Romance languages contract prepositions and articles (Italian _di + il_ → _del_), or how clitic pronouns and auxiliaries cluster in Balkan languages. In our creole, _“on a barn”_ would be realized as **“onabarn”** (with _on+a_ prefixed to “barn”), as given. This kind of clustering has precedent in natural languages: many languages allow sequences of clitics (e.g. prepositions, articles) to attach to a content word as a unit. We will apply this rule in the translations, eliminating spaces between these function words and the nouns/verbs they accompany.

**Wh-Phrase Copying in Questions (2d):** Wh- questions in the creole exhibit a striking **wh-copying** strategy. The wh-phrase appears not only in sentence-initial position, but is also pronounced at the start of each subordinate clause _and_ in its original base position. This resembles phenomena observed in some languages and learner speech where long-distance wh-movement leaves overt copies. For instance, certain German dialects and Afrikaans use wh-copying: cf. an Afrikaans example _“_ _**Watter meisie**_ _sê hy_ _**watter meisie**_ _kom vanaand kuier?”_ (“Which girl did he say **which girl** is coming to visit tonight?”). Here **“watter meisie”** (“which girl”) is repeated in the matrix clause, embedded clause, and the gap position. Our creole does the same: _“Which cake did you say which cake Mary cooked which cake?”_ has the wh-phrase “which cake” at the front, at the start of the embedded clause, and again where Mary’s object would be. This is reminiscent of natural wh-copy constructions documented by linguists. It diverges from standard English (which only fronts one wh-word), but is a consistent rule in the creole’s syntax for clarity.

**Transitive Expletive ‘there’ (2e):** The expletive **“there”** is used in the creole with **transitive verbs** when the logical subject is indefinite, akin to Icelandic **transitive expletive constructions**. In Icelandic, for example, one can say _“Það hafa margir jólasveinar borðað búðinginn”_ which literally means “**There have** many elves **eaten** the pudding,” where “many elves” is an indefinite subject after the verb. Only Icelandic (among the Germanic languages) permits such constructions freely. Our creole similarly allows “there” to introduce a clause even if a transitive verb follows, provided the subject is nonspecific (“indefinite”). This is an extension of English existential _there_, now applicable to active sentences. We will see this in the translation of sentence (e), where an indefinite subject (“some rat”) is introduced by **“there”**. This usage echoes Icelandic’s syntax and relaxes standard English’s constraint (which normally forbids “there” with an active transitive).

**Comparative Adjective Reduplication (2f):** The creole forms comparatives by **partial reduplication** of the adjective or adverb. Specifically, the first **consonant + vowel** of the base adjective is copied as a prefix to the adjective. (If the adjective begins with a vowel, we insert an _m_ between the repeated vowel and the base; if it begins with a consonant cluster, we use the last consonant of the cluster plus the first vowel.) This process is modeled on the **emphatic reduplication in Turkish**, where an adjective like _“siyah”_ (“black”) becomes _“_ _**sim**_ _siyah”_ (“deep black”, very black) – here _si-_ (s+i) is copied and an epenthetic _m_ is inserted, yielding “sim-”. Another example: _“güzel”_ (“pretty”) → _“_ _**güpgü**_ _zel”_ (“very pretty”), where _gü_ (g+ü) is doubled with an inserted _p_. These are not comparatives in Turkish but intensive forms; our creole repurposes a similar mechanism for **“more X”** comparisons. For instance, “sweeter” (more sweet) might be rendered as **“wesweet”**, taking “sweet” (which starts with consonant cluster _sw-_) and prefixing **we-** (from _w_ \+ _e_). This kind of reduplication-based grading is inspired by patterns in Turkish and other languages that create intensified or comparative meanings via reduplication. It departs from the English “-er” suffix or separate “more”, instead using a prefixed reduplicant to convey “more”. We will apply this to sentence (f).

**Superlative by Doubling (2g):** The creole expresses superlative **“most X”** or highest degree by **full reduplication (doubling)** of the adjective/adverb. Essentially, the adjective is stated twice in a row to signify the “-est” or “most” meaning. Reduplication for intensification or superlative effect is widely attested cross-linguistically. For example, in Fa d’Ambô Creole Portuguese, _“féyu”_ (“ugly”) doubled as **“fé féyu”** means “very ugly” (literally “ugly ugly”). In some languages, this strategy equates to a superlative or an intensifier meaning “extremely X”. Our creole adopts doubling to mean “the X-est”. Thus _“the most beautiful”_ would be rendered as **“beautiful beautiful”**, and _“fastest”_ as **“fast fast”**, etc. We will see this in sentence (g). (Notably, this is analogous to how, say, Mandarin Chinese can repeat adjectives for emphasis, or how some English speakers might say “It’s hot, hot!” to mean “super hot”.) The definite article may still be used if needed (and prefixed to the doubled adjective phrase), but no separate “most” word appears – double saying the adjective communicates it is the maximal degree.

Now, let us **apply these features** to each sentence in (1), explaining each transformation step:

**(1a) “The cat is in the room.”** – This is an **intransitive** predication (location of “the cat”), so the subject “the cat” will be in the **nominative (absolutive)** case (no ergative marking). We convert word order to **SOV**, so the verb “is” (copula) should come at the end. Next, we **prefix the article** “the” onto “cat”: **“thecat”**. The locative phrase “in the room” becomes a single unit: we prefix the preposition and article onto “room”. “in the room” → **“intheroom”** (`in+the+room`). The copula “is” here functions as the main verb (a stative verb), so we leave it at the end (we do **not** treat it as a detachable auxiliary since it’s the copular verb). Putting it all together: **“Thecat intheroom is.”** This translated sentence places the verb last (SOV) and shows the merged preposition+article prefix. _(We considered attaching “is” as a prefix — “thecat isintheroom” — but since “is” is the main verb, we keep it in final position to clearly illustrate verb-final order.)_

> **Transl. (1a):** **“Thecat intheroom is.”** \> _(Meaning: “The cat is in the room.”)_

_Process check:_ “The cat” → **thecat** (article prefix; no case marker because intransitive). “in the room” → **intheroom** (preposition+article clitic cluster). SOV order ⇒ “thecat intheroom is.” This aligns with an SOV structure seen in Hindi, Japanese, etc. and uses Hindi’s nominative (no marking) for the intransitive subject.

**(1b) “The men loaded the truck with hay.”** – **Transitive clause** (agent “the men”, object “the truck”). The verb “loaded” will go to sentence-final position. The subject “the men” is **ergative-marked** (since “load” is transitive). In Hindi, the ergative marker is _\-ne_, so we suffix **\-ne**: **“themen-ne”**. (“the men” also gets the article “the” prefixed: _the+men_). The object “the truck” is definite; in Hindi such a direct object would often take _\-ko_. We attach **\-ko** to mark the absolutive object (showing influence of Hindi’s differential object marking). Also prefix “the” to “truck”: **“thetruck-ko”**. The instrument phrase “with hay” becomes a prefix cluster: **“withhay”** (with+hay). Now assemble in SOV order: Subject (erg) – Object – Oblique – Verb. Thus: **“Themen-ne thetruck-ko withhay loaded.”** This means literally “The men-ERG the-truck-ACC with-hay loaded.” All features are visible: ergative _\-ne_ on the subject, cliticized “the”, and verb-final order.

> **Transl. (1b):** **“Themen-ne thetruck-ko withhay loaded.”** \> _(Meaning: “The men loaded the truck with hay.”)_

_Process check:_ “The men” → **themen-ne** (article fused, ergative _\-ne_ added). “the truck” → **thetruck-ko** (article fused, _\-ko_ on definite object). “with hay” → **withhay** (preposition fused as prefix). Verb “loaded” at end. Ergativity borrowed from Hindi is reflected by _\-ne_ on the agent, and the clustering of “with+hay” is consistent with the creole’s agglutinative trend.

**(1c) “The dogs are barking.”** – This sentence describes an ongoing action by “the dogs” (plural subject). “Bark” is intransitive (no object), so “the dogs” will be nominative/absolutive (no _\-ne_). We prefix the article: **“thedogs”**. The verb form “are barking” consists of auxiliary “are” + present participle “barking.” In our creole, auxiliaries attach as prefixes to the main verb. So **“are” will prefix to “barking”**, forming **“arebarking”** as a single verb complex. We then place this at the end (SOV order – though there is no object, the verb still comes last after the subject). The final sentence becomes: **“Thedogs arebarking.”** This translates literally to “The-dogs are-barking,” where _are-_ is a clitic indicating present tense plural auxiliary. Such cliticization of auxiliaries is parallel to clitic forms in other languages (cf. Slavic clitic auxiliaries).

> **Transl. (1c):** **“Thedogs arebarking.”** \> _(Meaning: “The dogs are barking.”)_

_Process check:_ “The dogs” → **thedogs** (article fused, no case suffix since intransitive). “are barking” → **arebarking** (auxiliary _are_ prefixed to verb “barking”). Verb-final structure achieved trivially as “arebarking” follows the subject. The cluster **arebarking** shows how an auxiliary attaches to a content verb, a feature of our creole.

**(1d) “What did you say that Mary buy?”** – This corresponds to a wh-question with an embedded clause (“…that Mary buy”). The English sentence is ungrammatical as given (perhaps intended: “What did you say that Mary bought?”). In our creole, we’ll implement the **wh-copying** rule (2d). The wh-phrase here is “what”. We place **“what”** at the start of the matrix question, and also at the start of the embedded clause **and** in the object position of “buy” within the embedded clause. The basic word order will be SOV and ergative marking where appropriate. Let’s break it down:

* Main clause: “you said that Mary buy what.” In SOV, “you” (subject) – “that Mary buy what” (object clause) – “said” (verb). “You” is a transitive subject (you**said**something), so it takes_\-ne_:**“you-ne”**(assuming “you” is indefinite here just as a pronoun, we apply ergative). The verb “said” goes to the end.
* Embedded clause: “Mary buy what.” “Mary” is the subject of “buy”, which is transitive. So “Mary” gets ergative_\-ne_:**Mary-ne**. The object of “buy” is “what” – indefinite, we can mark it absolutive (no marker or perhaps_\-ko_, but “what” as an interrogative pronoun we likely leave unmarked). According to rule (2d), we put “what” at the**beginning**of this embedded clause as well, effectively doubling it in that clause. So it appears before “Mary-ne”_and_after (in object position).
* Now add the wh at the very front of the whole sentence too. So the sequence begins with “What” (the wh-word copied to matrix front), then presumably the main clause subject etc.

Assembling it: **“What you-ne \[what Mary-ne what buy\] said?”**. We also prefix any relevant function words: no articles here, but “did” (past auxiliary) in English question is not needed in our creole (tense can be handled by context or a clitic on “said” if needed). We might simply use the past form of “say” or a tense prefix. For simplicity, we can omit “did” entirely (since many languages don’t use a dummy auxiliary for questions). The result with wh-copying is: **“What you-ne what Mary-ne what buy said?”**. This directly exemplifies the structure: the wh-word “what” is present at the start of the question, at the start of the embedded clause (“…what Mary …”), and in the object position of “buy”. Such repetition is similar to documented wh-copy constructions.

To make it clearer, we can also **prefix** complementizer “that” to the embedded clause if needed: e.g., “that” could be a prefix on “Mary” (“thatMary-ne”), but the question already has multiple wh, so I will leave “that” implicit or treat it as optional (some languages drop “that” in speech). If we include it, it might appear as a prefix _“thatMary-ne”_. However, to keep focus on wh, I’ll omit an explicit “that”.

> **Transl. (1d):** **“What you-ne what Mary-ne what buy said?”** \> _(Meaning: “What did you say that Mary bought?”)_

_Process check:_ We fronted “what” in the main clause and repeated “what” in the embedded clause’s Spec position and object position. “you” (transitive subject of “say”) got ergative -ne; “Mary” (transitive subject of “buy”) got -ne. SOV order: “you-ne … said” with the subordinate clause as the object. The structure is non-standard for English but follows our creole’s wh-copy rule and ergative marking. (This construction emphasizes the questioned object through repetition, a trait observed in languages with wh-copying.)

**(1e) “Some rat ate the cheese.”** – This is a transitive event with an indefinite subject “some rat”. According to rule (2e), we can use an expletive “there” because the subject is indefinite. In the creole, we begin the sentence with **“There”** (expletive pronoun). The real subject “some rat” will follow. We treat “some rat” as the logical subject of a transitive verb “ate”, so we give it the ergative marker _\-ne_: **“some rat-ne”**. (“Some” is a determiner, not an article, so we do not prefix it – we leave “some” separate as in English.) Next, the object “the cheese” is definite, so we prefix the article and optionally mark it with _\-ko_. “the cheese” → **“thecheese-ko”**. The verb “ate” goes at the end (SOV). Thus we get: **“There some rat-ne thecheese-ko ate.”**. This construction is modeled on Icelandic transitive expletives, where an expletive leads and the indefinite subject appears post-verbally or lower in the clause. In our creole’s SOV structure, “some rat-ne” still comes before the object and verb (we might imagine that in a more Icelandic-like structure it could follow the verb, but to keep consistent SOV ordering, we place it before the object here). The presence of “there” signals that the subject is non-specific, similar to English existential “There is a rat that ate the cheese,” except we’re not using a subordinate clause.

This sentence shows that the creole allows an expletive with a verb like “ate” (transitive), which standard English disallows. It’s grammatically fine here because “some rat” is indefinite. The ergative marking _\-ne_ on “rat” still indicates it’s the agent of eating, despite “there” occupying the initial slot.

> **Transl. (1e):** **“There somerat-ne thecheese-ko ate.”** \> _(Meaning: “There \[was\] some rat ate the cheese.” i.e. “Some rat ate the cheese.”)_

_Process check:_ “some rat” → **some rat-ne** (ergative marked, subject is indefinite). “the cheese” → **thecheese-ko** (article fused, object marked _\-ko_ for specificity). Introduced “There” at start as expletive. Verb “ate” final. This mirrors Icelandic usage where an expletive allows an indefinite subject with a transitive verb. (Note: The structure without “there” would simply be “Somerat-ne thecheese-ko ate.”, which is also grammatical in the creole. The expletive adds an emphasis that such a rat existed, akin to saying “There was a rat that ate the cheese.”)

**(1f) “I want a sweeter dish.”** – This is a transitive construction (“I want \[something\]”). Subject “I” is ergative-marked (_\-ne_) because “want” is transitive. So **“I-ne”** (“I” + ergative). The object is “a sweeter dish”. We handle the adjective “sweeter” with the **comparative reduplication** rule. The base adjective is “sweet”. It starts with the consonant cluster _sw_. According to our rule, we take the last consonant of that cluster (_w_) plus the first vowel (_ee_ → “e”) and prefix that. Thus _sweet_ → **we-sweet**. (This forms something like “wesweet”, meaning “more sweet” or “sweeter”). We then need to prefix the article “a” onto the first content word of the object phrase. The phrase “a sweeter dish” in SOV order will still be “\[a sweeter dish\]” as a noun phrase object. The first content word of this NP is the adjective “wesweet”. So we attach “a” to “wesweet”: **“awesweet”**. Now “dish” follows. So the object NP becomes **“awesweet dish”**. (No additional case marker on “dish” here, since in ergative alignment the object is absolutive; we might omit a _\-ko_ because it’s an indefinite nonspecific object.) Finally, the verb “want” goes at the end. “want” is a main verb here, but note that in English “want” doesn’t need an auxiliary. We have no extra articles or auxiliaries in front of it to prefix; we simply place “want” at the end. Thus the whole sentence: **“I-ne awesweet dish want.”**. This reads as “I-ERG a+we-sweet dish want.”

Let’s interpret “awesweet”: we formed “we-sweet” to mark the comparative (like “more sweet”), and we prefixed “a”. The reduplicative prefix “we-” is analogous to the Turkish-style intensification prefix (e.g. _büyük_ “big” → _bebüyük_ for “bigger” in our scheme, hypothetically). This makes “wesweet” mean “more sweet” (sweeter). We had to insert an epenthetic consonant for cluster _sw_, which the rule provided (taking “w” from the cluster). The result “awesweet” is somewhat complex morphologically, but it demonstrates the rule.

> **Transl. (1f):** **“I-ne awesweet dish want.”** \> _(Meaning: “I want a sweeter dish.”)_

_Process check:_ “I” → **I-ne** (ergative marked first person). “a sweeter dish” → **a + \[we+sweet\] dish** \= **awesweet dish**. Verb “want” at end. We see partial reduplication on “sweet” (sw**e**et → **we**sweet) to convey “comparative”. The article is prefixed (`a + wesweet`). The ergative marking on “I” shows the transitive subject. In essence, this could be glossed as “I (ERG) a-more-sweet dish want.”

**(1g) “The most beautiful homes have been sold.”** – This sentence features a **superlative** (“the most beautiful”) and a passive/perfect construction (“have been sold”). Let’s handle the subject phrase first: “the most beautiful homes.” Using rule (2g), **superlative by doubling**, “the most beautiful” becomes **“the beautiful beautiful”**. We drop the separate word “most” and instead repeat “beautiful”. We also prefix “the” as required. Now, we must be careful how to prefix “the” here: The phrase “beautiful beautiful homes” – the first content word is the first “beautiful”. So we attach “the” to **beautiful**: **“thebeautiful”**, then a space, then the second “beautiful”. Thus the subject phrase is **“thebeautiful beautiful homes”**. (This corresponds to “the very beautiful homes” meaning “the most beautiful homes.”)

Next, the verb phrase “have been sold.” In our creole, auxiliaries cluster as prefixes onto the main verb. “Have been sold” consists of two auxiliaries (“have” for perfect, “been” for passive) plus the main verb “sold.” We cluster **“havebeen”** as a prefix onto “sold”: **“havebeensold”**. This entire cluster will function as the verb. We place it at the end (verb-final). Now, concerning case: “homes” is the subject of a passive sentence. In English it’s patient, not agent. In an ergative system, intransitive or passive subjects would normally be absolutive (unmarked). Since “sell” is originally transitive, “homes” are underlying objects (absolutive) that got promoted to subject. We will _not_ use an ergative marker on “homes” because they are not the agent of a transitive action here (there is no explicit agent). So “homes” stays unmarked (nominative/absolutive). Additionally, because “homes” is plural and definite, Hindi might mark it with _\-ko_ if it were a direct object – but here it’s syntactically a subject. We’ll leave it unmarked to represent absolutive case.

So the assembled sentence: **“Thebeautiful beautiful homes havebeensold.”**. This reads as “The beautiful (reduplicated) homes have-been-sold.” The double “beautiful” encodes the superlative (essentially “most beautiful”). The cluster **havebeensold** shows auxiliaries prefixed to the verb. Notably, **“havebeensold”** is at the end, fulfilling SOV order (the whole verb complex is final).

> **Transl. (1g):** **“Thebeautiful beautiful homes havebeensold.”** \> _(Meaning: “The most beautiful homes have been sold.”)_

_Process check:_ “the most beautiful homes” → **thebeautiful beautiful homes** (definite article prefixed to first “beautiful”; adjective “beautiful” doubled for superlative). No ergative on “homes” because the verb “sell” here is passive (no explicit agent). Verb “have been sold” → **havebeensold** (clustered auxiliaries as prefix on “sold”). This cluster is placed at sentence end. The outcome showcases both the reduplicative superlative (as in many languages where doubling marks intensity) and the auxiliary-cliticization. It’s equivalent to saying “The extremely beautiful homes sold (have been).”

**(1h) “He could come earlier.”** – This involves a **modal** (“could”) and a comparative adverb (“earlier” = “more early”). The subject “He” is performing an intransitive action “come”, so “he” will be nominative (no _\-ne_). We prefix nothing to “He” (no article, it’s a pronoun). Next, “could” is a modal auxiliary, which in our creole will attach to the main verb “come”. So we plan to form **“couldcome”** as a single cluster. Now, “earlier” (comparative of “early”) should be formed via partial reduplication (2f). Base “early” starts with a vowel _e_. Rule: if an adjective/adverb begins with a vowel, we copy the vowel and insert “m” in between. So “early” → **“e” + “m” + “early”** \= **“emearly”**. This “emearly” means “more early” (earlier). Now we have to place “emearly” in the sentence. In an SOV language, adverbs of time often appear before the verb (e.g., “He earlier come” essentially). We will put **“emearly”** before the verb cluster. Finally, we attach the modal “could” to “come” as **“couldcome”**, and put that at the end. The assembled order: **“He emearly couldcome.”**. This literally reads “He more-early could-come.” It means “He could come earlier.”

Let’s double-check clitics: “could” as a modal prefix sticks to “come”. No article or preposition to prefix in this sentence. Case: “He” is not marked (intransitive subject). So that’s done. One might ask: could we alternatively have attached “could” to “emearly” instead (since “earlier” is also a content word)? We treat “earlier” as an adjunct; the modal scopes over the verb “come”, so we attach it to the verb. The phrase “come earlier” as a whole has “come” as the main verb, which is where a modal clitic naturally attaches (similar to how in French, e.g., “il **pourrait venir** tôt” – one could imagine “pourrait” attaching to “venir” in a synthetic language). So **couldcome** is our verb complex. The word “emearly” comes before it as an adverb. The final word order “He \[adv\] \[V\]” is acceptable in SOV (many SOV languages put temporal adverbs before the verb).

> **Transl. (1h):** **“He emearly couldcome.”** \> _(Meaning: “He could come earlier.”)_

_Process check:_ “He” → **He** (no case suffix, intransitive subject). “earlier” → **emearly** (partial reduplication: _e_ \+ m + early; the _e_ from “early” is copied, _m_ inserted). Modal “could” + verb “come” → **couldcome** (cluster). We place “emearly” before the verb cluster to keep verb-final order. The comparative “emearly” shows the vowel reduplication rule (vowel-initial “early” gets prefixed with “e(m)-”) and effectively conveys “more early”. The final structure can be glossed as “He more-early could-come.”

In each of the above translations, we observe the interplay of the creole’s new features: **ergative case marking** from Hindi (-ne on transitive subjects, -ko on specific objects), **SOV word order**, and **prefixation of function words** (articles, prepositions, modals, auxiliaries) as clitics. The wh-question exemplifies the unusual **wh-copying** strategy found in some languages, and the expletive usage shows an Icelandic-like tolerance for **“there” with active verbs**. The **reduplication processes** for comparatives and superlatives are inspired by patterns in Turkish and other languages, where reduplication intensifies meaning. Overall, these translations illustrate a plausible English-based creole, 500 years in the future, enriched by typological features from Hindi, Turkish, Icelandic, etc., as specified in (2). Each change is grounded in real-world linguistic phenomena, as supported by the references below.

How many gene therapies have gained regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of hemophilia as of October 15th 2024\. Include the name of the developer company, as well as the respective year of approval. Provide a comprehensive summary of the viral vector technology employed in each of these approved therapies, highlighting key features.

As of October 15, 2024, **three** gene therapy products have been approved in the U.S. for treating hemophilia (two for hemophilia B and one for hemophilia A). These are:

* **Hemgenix** (etranacogene dezaparvovec-drlb) – _Developer:_ CSL Behring (in partnership with uniQure); _FDA Approval:_ 2022\. This was the first gene therapy for hemophilia B. Hemgenix is an in vivo **AAV** (adeno-associated virus) vector-based therapy delivering a functional **Factor IX (FIX)** gene. It uses an AAV serotype-5 capsid engineered to target **hepatocytes** (liver cells), where FIX is normally produced. The delivered gene is a **codon-optimized “Padua” variant** of human FIX, a high-activity mutant (R338L) that produces **5–8× higher** FIX clotting activity than the wild-type protein. A liver-specific promoter drives FIX expression in transduced cells. A one-time IV infusion of this AAV5-Padua FIX construct can achieve sustained elevation of FIX levels and reduce bleeding episodes, obviating the need for regular prophylactic factor infusions.
* **Roctavian** (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) – _Developer:_ BioMarin Pharmaceutical; _FDA Approval:_ 2023\. This is the first gene therapy for hemophilia A. Roctavian also uses an **AAV5** viral vector, which carries a human **Factor VIII (FVIII)** gene insert. Because the FVIII gene is large, Roctavian’s transgene is a **B-domain–deleted** FVIII (a shortened version of the gene with the non-essential B domain removed) so that it fits within the AAV’s packaging capacity. The AAV5 vector is administered as a one-time IV infusion and transduces liver cells, leading to **endogenous production of Factor VIII in hepatocytes**. This raises the patient’s FVIII levels and reduces bleeding risk long-term. (Notably, patients are screened to ensure they have no pre-existing neutralizing antibodies against AAV5, since anti-capsid immunity would block the gene delivery.)
* **Beqvez** (fidanacogene elaparvovec-dzkt) – _Developer:_ Pfizer; _FDA Approval:_ 2024\. This is the second gene therapy for hemophilia B (approved in April 2024). Beqvez employs a modified **AAV** vector with a **serotype rh74** capsid (AAVrh74 variant) to deliver a FIX gene to the liver. Like Hemgenix, it encodes a **hyperactive FIX Padua variant (R338L)** to maximize clotting activity. The AAVrh74 capsid was chosen for its strong tropism for hepatocytes (the natural site of FIX synthesis) and relatively low prevalence of pre-existing immunity in humans. A single infusion of this AAVrh74-Padua FIX therapy enables the patient’s own liver to produce functional FIX, dramatically reducing or eliminating bleeding events and the need for regular FIX prophylaxis. (Patients must test negative for antibodies against the AAVrh74 capsid before receiving Beqvez, similar to the antibody screening required for Hemgenix/Roctavian.)

**Sources:** FDA approvals and company announcements for Hemgenix (2022), Roctavian (2023), and Beqvez (2024); and published summaries of each therapy’s AAV vector design and features. Each therapy uses a **non-replicating AAV vector** to deliver a **one-time, liver-directed gene transfer**, with serotype-specific capsids (AAV5 or AAVrh74) and optimized transgene cassettes (Padua FIX or B-domain–deleted FVIII) to achieve long-term clotting factor production in hemophilia patients.

## Limitations

Deep research unlocks significant new capabilities, but it’s still early and has limitations. It can sometimes hallucinate facts in responses or make incorrect inferences, though at a notably lower rate than existing ChatGPT models, according to internal evaluations. It may struggle with distinguishing authoritative information from rumors, and currently shows weakness in confidence calibration, often failing to convey uncertainty accurately. At launch, there may be minor formatting errors in reports and citations, and tasks may take longer to kick off. We expect all these issues to quickly improve with more usage and time.

## Access

Deep research in ChatGPT is currently very compute intensive. The longer it takes to research a query, the more inference compute is required. We are starting with a version optimized for **Pro users** today, with up to 100 queries per month. **Plus and Team users** will get access next, followed by Enterprise. We are still working on bringing access to users in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the European Economic Area. 

All paid users will soon get significantly higher rate limits when we release a faster, more cost-effective version of deep research powered by a smaller model that still provides high quality results. 

In the coming weeks and months, we’ll be working on the technical infrastructure, closely monitoring the current release, and conducting even more rigorous testing. This aligns with our principle of iterative deployment. If all safety checks continue to meet our release standards, we anticipate releasing deep research to Plus users in about a month.

## What's next

Deep research is available today on ChatGPT web, and will be rolled out to mobile and desktop apps within the month. Currently, deep research can access the open web and any uploaded files. In the future, you’ll be able to connect to more specialized data sources—expanding its access to subscription-based or internal resources—to make its output even more robust and personalized.

Looking further ahead, we envision agentic experiences coming together in ChatGPT for asynchronous, real-world research and execution. The combination of deep research, which can perform asynchronous online investigation, and Operator, which can take real-world action, will enable ChatGPT to carry out increasingly sophisticated tasks for you.

**_February 3, 2025 addendum_**_: We conducted rigorous safety testing, preparedness evaluations, and governance reviews on the early version of o3 that powers deep research, identifying it as_ [_Medium_⁠(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/openai-preparedness-framework-beta.pdf) _risk. We also ran additional safety testing to better understand incremental risks associated with deep research's ability to browse the web, and we have added new mitigations. We will continue to thoroughly test and closely monitor the current limited release. We will share our safety insights and safeguards for deep research in a system card when we widen access to Plus users._
